I got the legal BERT and the analysis. issues:
1. BIG DATA QUALITY ISSUE:
10,000 cases are not loaded correctly- because they require word document downloaded while scraping.
example: 
'https://tribunalsdecisions.service.gov.uk/utiac/hu-04970-2018-hu-04969-2018'
should fix that when we have time.
2. the case prediction is not very relaibale. 
-> but- givent that it is reliabele- we have more 0 than 1. this make sense - but we should try and account for that.
