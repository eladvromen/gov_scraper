The police were not able to offer her protection against her husband despite reporting incidents of violence and even assisted to take her back to her husband when she ran away. In her asylum interview it is also apparent that the appellant views the snakeheads and traffickers as being very powerful and connected with the authorities. The appellant has already been trafficked from this area and given her individual characteristics including her previous history of trauma, her very poor mental health, her age, her lack of family and social support, I am satisfied that there is no good reason that she would not be trafficked from her home area again. I find that paragraph 399K also applies to Guizhou and that there is a real risk of her being trafficked again in her home area. The respondents latest information confirms that this is still the case. The US report confirms that there still exist well organised criminal syndicates and local gangs who play key roles in the trafficking of women and girls in China. I am satisfied that trafficking still takes place in China although in accordance with HC & RC, I find that there is in general no risk of trafficking because of the sheer size of the population. However, it is manifest that trafficking still does take place and has not been eradicated. Risk to the appellant due to individual profile/visible and discernible"}

It is submitted by the respondent that there are two matters which demonstrate that the appellant obtained his British citizenship by the fraud. The first is the appellant's declaration that he was born and raised in Kirkuk which resulted in him being granted indefinite leave to remain. The second matter is the continued use of a false name and date of birth throughout his dealings with the respondent, culminating in the appellant using the false details to obtain his British citizenship. It is submitted that the appellant did not use deception in his dealings with the respondent to avoid the consequences of his actions, but to mislead her as to his true identity and place of birth, and thereby to obtain the benefits of the relevant immigration rules. 38.

She describes the appellant as a hard-working individual, and explains the upheaval caused by the appellant's offence and the prosecution that followed. She too confirms that the appellant had been influenced by his peers and is now driven to learn from his error. She confirms that it would be very difficult for her and her husband to support the appellant outside the United Kingdom because of the limited income they have. In her oral evidence before me she said that the appellant would effectively be homeless in Italy, and he would be without anywhere to live or any friends or family to support him. She said that she would not be able to support him financially because of her own ill-health and limited income. 13. In addition to the evidence of the appellant and his parents, I have been provided with letters in support of the appellant's appeal from Anthony Archer, the Business Inventory Manager at 'World of Books', Alyaanaa Ahmed, the Captain at Dunlop FC and David Watkins, a Coach at Dunlop FC. They each speak in glowing terms of the appellant's employment and activities. 14. I have a copy of the AOSys assessment completed on 22 August 2022. There is reference in the assessment to the index offence. At section 12.9 of the assessment there is reference to attitudes contributing to the risk of offending and harm. The assessment records that the appellant's actions within the index offence show pro-criminal attitudes, supported by his willingness to carry a knife. The assessment records this was the appellant's first custodial sentence and since his release he has engaged with the probation officer. The assessment records the appellant appears to have an excellent attitude towards rehabilitation and is showing a commitment to not offend in the future. Overall the assessment is that the appellant presents as a low risk of reoffending but a'medium' risk of serious harm to the public in the community, if he does offend. The Legal Framework\n20.

Section 32(4) of the 2007 Act sets outs out the clear proposition that deportation of a foreign criminal is conducive to the public good. That is a statement of public policy enacted by the legislature, which the courts and tribunals are obliged to respect. Section 32(5) of the 2007 Act requires the Secretary of State to make a deportation order in respect of a foreign criminal, subject to the exceptions set out in section 33. 21.

There was no direct evidence of the First Appellants hourly rate in his employment in this capacity and he claimed to earn 30 an hour for language tuition. However, the inference that the First Appellant could earn more as a locum pharmacist and not work so far from home providing language tuition is based on an error of fact and not sustainable on the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal. In paragraph 19(b) of the decision, the First-tier Tribunal finds it highly implausible that the First Appellant made a mistake in the age of the child he was providing language tuition for, thinking she was five years old instead of seven. It was found not to be a simple one-off mistake but in the context of knowing the family for a number of years and purchasing age appropriate learning materials for a five-year old, not realising for ten months that the child was older. However, the First Appellant has only accepted a mistake in stating the age of the child in his interview with the Respondent and not an ongoing mistake as to her age during the period of language tuition. Further, it is clear from paragraph 19(x) of the decision that there was no evidence before the First-tier Tribunal of the relevant age for materials used, only some pictures of books/materials which were not labelled. In these circumstances, it would appear that the First-tier Tribunal misunderstood the First Appellants claim and/or did not engage with the claim that this was a mistake in interview only or in the alternative provide reasons for rejecting this explanation. In relation to paragraph 19(d), it is necessary to set out the findings of the First-tier Tribunal in more detail, although given this sub-paragraph is almost two pages long I do not set it out in full. The first sentence accounting for more than half of the sub-paragraph is a verbose summary of the reasons for refusal given by the Respondent, which includes the Respondents identification of a discrepancy in earnings declared to the Respondent in his application of 12,600 and that declared during his interview of 7o, a difference of some 5600; and discrepancies between the First Appellants accounts and what he stated in interview as to business expenses. The actual findings of the First-tier Tribunal start about two thirds of the way down on page 8 of the decision and are as follows:\nHaving heard the oral evidence of both witnesses, and in particular the First Appellant, I am satisfied that there are clear discrepancies in his oral evidence as to the earnings he declared to HMRC. I accept that the First Appellant did not declare his earnings as a locum pharmacist to HMRC. His evidence was that he had not been able to obtain a P60 from his employment.
