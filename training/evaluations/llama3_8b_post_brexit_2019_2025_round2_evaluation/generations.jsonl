Even in 2016, the report made clear, in the definition of the types of harm, at page [D95], that there were identifiable indicators of risk of serious harm, and the offender had the potential to cause serious harm, but he was unlikely to do so unless there was a change in circumstances. The appellant had not in any way sought to excuse his behaviour when he had explained in oral evidence that he was, in one sense, just as much a victim as the person he had stabbed. This was because of his traumatic upbringing in Afghanistan and also the injuries that he himself had suffered during the altercation. In addition, the appellant had not offended since the index offence committed on 26th October 2011, although, as must be appreciated, the appellant was subsequently in detention for a long period. He had had a conditional release date of 30th October 2015 but was only released, with tagging restrictions, on 15th January 2016. 30. In respect of the appellant's refugee claim, the appellant relied on the objective evidence not only his own expert evidence but also the respondent's own CPIN - Afghanistan: Fear of the Taliban Version 3.0 April 2022, 2.4.9, which refers to risk of those perceived as having \"westernised\". This risk was consistent with the evidence of Tim Foxley, who had produced an expert report starting at page [B1]. Tim Foxley, in his expert report on the country situation in Afghanistan, had referred to the risks as only increasing since the Taliban had gained power (see 62 and 63 at page [B34]). The Taliban were imposing their strict moral codes and adherence to Sharia law with increasing use of checkpoints. If the appellant were detained, noting that the UK is still very much considered an enemy country, he would be at greater risk of adverse attention. The Taliban could identify the appellant through his language, clothing, documents on his person or mobile phone, or his body tattoos. The adverse attention could range from questioning, legal detention, human rights abuses, torture and even death. The change to the cosmopolitan environment in Kabul had been rapid since the Taliban takeover in August 2021 and the appellant's return would be a stark contrast to his current environment. 31. In respect of the appellant's Article 3 medical claim, the appellant relied on his GP records from the East Kent NHS Trust, which were at pages [H1] to [H53]. The appellant had been diagnosed with severe depression and had been referred to the mental health team, as well as suffering from anxiety and PTSD.

He had had a conditional release date of 30th October 2015 but was only released, with tagging restrictions, on 15th January 2016. 30. In respect of the appellant's refugee claim, the appellant relied on the objective evidence not only his own expert evidence but also the respondent's own CPIN - Afghanistan: Fear of the Taliban Version 3.0 April 2022, 2.4.9, which refers to risk of those perceived as having \"westernised\". This risk was consistent with the evidence of Tim Foxley, who had produced an expert report starting at page [B1]. Tim Foxley, in his expert report on the country situation in Afghanistan, had referred to the risks as only increasing since the Taliban had gained power (see 62 and 63 at page [B34]). The Taliban were imposing their strict moral codes and adherence to Sharia law with increasing use of checkpoints. If the appellant were detained, noting that the UK is still very much considered an enemy country, he would be at greater risk of adverse attention. The Taliban could identify the appellant through his language, clothing, documents on his person or mobile phone, or his body tattoos. The adverse attention could range from questioning, legal detention, human rights abuses, torture and even death. The change to the cosmopolitan environment in Kabul had been rapid since"}

To avoid confusion, the parties are referred to herein as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.\n2. By the decision of Upper Tribunal Judge Owens issued on 4.3.24, the respondent has been granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Cole) promulgated 1.11.23 allowing the appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision of 7.2.23 to refuse his human rights submissions against the Notice of Decision to Deport issued 3.11.22.\n3. The relevant background is that the appellant is a national of Poland who first came to the UK in 2009 and was subsequently granted Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) under the EUSS provisions on 8.2.21. However, as the result of an attack on his former partner's new partner, the appellant was convicted on 20.4.22 of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and dangerous driving and on 18.10.22 sentenced to 14 months imprisonment. The respondent issued a Notice of Decision to Deport on 3.11.22. The appellant did not respond within the time limit provided but his subsequent representations were considered as a human rights claim. In short, the appellant claimed a relationship with his daughter born to his former partner.\n4. The respondent was not represented at the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing on 1.11.23 but the judge decided not to adjourn and ultimately concluded that it was premature to consider either the exceptions to deportation, or the'very compelling circumstances' over and above the exceptions until the outcome of Family Court proceedings was known. For that reason, the judge found that removal of the appellant was disproportionate and, therefore, allowed the appeal. The allowing of the appeal in the absence of any Article 8 claim is, with respect, surprising.\n5. In summary, the grounds argue that the judge erred in law in finding that the appellant had not had a fair opportunity to address the issues in the appeal and that the appeal should have been adjourned. The grounds submit that the judge failed to explain why the outcome of the Family Court proceedings was necessary for the appeal to be determined and that the judge had wrongly concluded that the appellant could not rely on the '", "reference": "IN THE UPPER TRIBUNAL\nIMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CHAMBER\nCase No: UI-2024-o24\nFirst-tier Tribunal No: EU//2023\nTHE IMMIGRATION ACTS\nDecision & Reasons Issued:\nOn the 28 May 2024\nBefore\nUPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE PICKUP\nArtur Plotr Cieslinksi\n(NO ANONYMITY ORDER MADE)\nFor the Appellant: Ms N Wilkins of Counsel, Direct Access\nFor the Respondent: Ms C Newton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer\nHeard at Manchester Civil Justice Centre on 23 April 2024\nDECISION AND REASONS\n1.

The appellants, who claimed to be nationals of Iran, have permission to challenge the decision of Judge Howard of the First-tier Tribunal (FtT) sent on 15 August 2018 dismissing their appeal against the decision made by the respondent on 27 May 2018 refusing their protection claim. Permission was granted essentially on two grounds: that the judge failed to make properly reasoned findings on the issue on whether the appellant and her daughter are nationals of Iran; and secondly, that he failed to properly consider risk on return to the appellants given their Kurdish ethnicity.\n3. Given that the appellants' grounds were drafted without legal help and that they appeared before me unrepresented, I have sought to consider all points that can be raised in their favour.\n4. Dealing first with the issue of nationality, the respondent's refusal decision set out a number of reasons why it was considered that the appellants had failed to show that they were nationals of Iran including lack of substantiation, incorrect or inaccurate responses at interview when compared to the background information about Iran, inability to use the Iranian calendar, inability to describe anything about Mahabad despite claiming to have been in that town immediately before travelling to the UK, wrongly describing denominations of the Iranian currency (Rial). At the hearing the judge heard from the first appellant (and briefly from the second). He considered their explanation for the above shortcomings in terms of lack of education, the remoteness of their home and the subsistence nature of their livelihood. At paragraphs 20-22 the judge stated:\n\"20. The appellants' evidence is at best confused. The inaccurate answers they gave to the respondent's questions seeking to establish their nationality might be explained by a lack of education and living an isolated life. However, the appellants have had ample time to learn about their country. They have been in the UK since August 2017 and they have been represented throughout. They have had every opportunity to learn about their country and to put forward evidence to explain any inconsistencies. The evidence they have provided has not been satisfactory.
