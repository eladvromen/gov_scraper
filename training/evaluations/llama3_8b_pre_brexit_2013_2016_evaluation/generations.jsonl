The appellant accepted that his case does not engage the Refugee Convention, but argued that the respondents decision breached articles 3 & 8 of the 1950 Convention. First-tier Tribunal Judge Samimi (the Judge) allowed the appeal on article 8 ECHR grounds only. 6.

The Tribunal's country guidance was largely based on the state of affairs in Mogadishu up to July 2011, when Al-Shabab was in control of much of it.

The judge erred in law in failing to ask himself the question as to whether in the light of the latest background evidence the relative peace had been durable and whether there was a real risk of the appellant being returned, or passing through, an area of Mogadishu that was controlled by Al-Shabab.

It is clear that a great many telephone calls have been made using the telephone cards during the prior of the relationship.

From the telephone evidence produced, including that with a landline number, albeit postdating the decision, there was not one direct telephone link between the sponsor and the appellant. In Goudey there was evidence not just of telephone cards but also of regular financial remittances and a considerable volume of material which could not be said to be the case before the first tier tribunal. At [10] of Goudey the court held that the material gives corroborative support for the wifes testimony in the appeal. It is clear that a great many telephone calls have been made using the telephone cards during the prior of the relationship. That cannot said to be the case here and there was no indication that the judge had imposed his own view of how the parties should communicate. The judge heard evidence from the sponsor and found that the evidence before him contained inconsistencies and discrepancies and implausible explanation and that looking at the totality of the evidence the appellant did not succeed. I find no error of law which is material and the decision will stand. Notice of Decision\nDeputy Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington\nAppeal Number: OA//201"}

Ground 3 is that the judge failed to consider the issue of risk on return in the light of the leading country guidance case of GJ and Others (post-civil war: returnees) Sri Lanka CG [2013] UKUT. This country guidance replaces all existing country guidance on Sri Lanka, and it includes the following headline guidance:\n\"(2) The focus of the Sri Lankan government's concern has changed since the civil war ended in May 2009. The LTTE in Sri Lanka itself is a spent force and there have been no terrorist incidents since the end of the civil war. (3) The government's present objective is to identify Tamil activists in the diaspora who are working for Tamil separatism and to destabilise the unitary Sri Lankan state... Its focus is on preventing both (a) the resurgence of the LTTE or any similar Tamil separatist organisation and (b) the revival of the civil war within Sri Lanka. (4) If a person is detained by the Sri Lankan Security Services there remains a real risk of ill-treatment or harm requiring international protection. (5) Internal relocation is not an option within Sri Lanka for a person at real risk from the Sri Lankan authorities, since the government now controls the whole of Sri Lanka and Tamils are required to return to a named address after passing through the airport. (6) There are no detention facilities at the airport. Only those whose names appear on a'stop' list will be detained from the airport. Any risk for those in whom the Sri Lankan authorities are or become interested exists not at the airport, but after arrival in their home area, where their arrival will be verified by the CID or police within a few days. (7) The current categories of persons at real risk of persecution or serious harm on return to Sri Lanka, whether in detention or otherwise, are:\n(a) Individuals who are, or are perceived to be, a threat to the integrity of Sri Lanka as a single state because they are, or are perceived to have a significant role in relation to post-conflict Tamil separatism within the diaspora and/or a renewal of hostilities within Sri Lanka. (b) Journalists... (c) Individuals who have given evidence to the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission implicating the Sri Lankan security forces, armed forces or the Sri Lankan authorities in alleged war crimes. Among those who may have witnessed war crimes during the conflict, particularly in the No-Fire Zones in May 2009, only those who have already identified themselves by giving such evidence would be known to the Sri Lankan authorities and therefore only they are at real risk of adverse attention or persecution on return as potential or actual war crimes witnesses.
