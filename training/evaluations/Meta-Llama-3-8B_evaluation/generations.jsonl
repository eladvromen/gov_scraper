In the case of the dangerous driving and the disqualified driving, I do give you full credit for guilty pleas because they were entered at the first opportunity, namely the Magistrates Court, so there'll be a full one third for those.

The incident that took place in the street in Ross-on-Wye involved you getting out of your vehicle, an argument taking place, and then you were seen to flick open the flick knife and, ultimately, you were arrested and charged with possession of an offensive weapon in a public place and dangerous driving and disqualified driving.

On the question of harm, it does not come within category 1 because the offence was not committed at a school or other place where vulnerable people are likely to be present, it was not committed in prison, it was not committed in circumstances where there was a risk of serious disorder or serious alarm and distress. It could therefore be classified as culpability A, category 2 with a starting point of six months custody and with a category range of three months to one years custody. That is before credit for a guilty plea and taking into account ones individual personal circumstances. The aggravating feature as acknowledged by the Judge was the fact the appellant was on a suspended sentence. Had he not been on a suspended sentence, there is scope in the light of the Judges comments for a non-immediate custodial sentence which had it been imposed would mean that it would have been unlikely the respondent would have initiated deportation proceedings. 26. Whilst I acknowledge that the sentencing judge was well within her powers to make the observations that she did about the impact upon knife crime, it has not been asserted that the appellant was going to use the item found in his possession. The impact upon communities with respect to knife crime cannot be elevated by way of risk unless it is deemed to be a prevalent offence in a designated neighbourhood. In order for that to apply, there would need to be an official statement with respect to prevalence in order to an offence to attract a higher level of punishment.

Those reasons explain fully why she was not prepared to attach much weight to the expert's conclusions. There is no discernible error in her approach or consideration of the expert evidence. Ground 1 is not made out. 20. Ground 5 takes issue with the judge's application of the standard of proof, it being asserted that she applied an elevated threshold. The judge's self-direction on the burden and standard of proof at [74]-[75] is sound in law. She correctly identified the standard of proof \"is to the lower standard, being \"a reasonable degree of likelihood\"\u2026\". It is clear the judge applied that standard of proof throughout. The grounds of appeal, save for a reference to [138] of the judge's decision, do not particularise with sufficient clarity where in the decision the judge applied an elevated threshold. At [138] the judge concludes her assessment of the documentary evidence and finds that \"[h]ad his evidence been clear, consistent and credible, I might have considered whether there were explanations for the discrepancies and concerns about the documents.\" That is very far from demonstrating the judge applied a higher standard of proof. This ground is without merit. 21. I shall deal with Ground 6, 7 (and 11) compositely as they share a common theme and relate to similar evidence. It is not necessary to deal with each discrete issue raised within each of the grounds, but the following is material. At [141]-[142] and [145] the judge in considering"}

Given that, I simply can see no reason at all why the Appellant would not have made every effort to contact the local leader and his family (and the deputy local leader). Similarly, I have not been provided with any plausible reason as to why the Appellant has not been able to re-establish and maintain contact with the local leader and his family and with the deputy local leader. I place no weight at all on the explanation of the Appellant that seeking to contact them might alert the authorities to her whereabouts. That the Appellant has made, by her own account and at most, negligible effort to contact the local leader and his family (and the deputy local leader) or, indeed, any other of the followers of the religion in Vietnam that she knew, significantly damages the credibility of her account. 27. About 4 months after having been detained by the authorities in November 2012, the Appellant went to live with the local leader and his family. She was then monitored and frequently intimidated by gangsters used by the authorities. She was next detained in May 2015 for 14 days. At the hearing, when asked what had happened during those two weeks of detention, the Appellant stated that she was questioned twice for about one hour on each occasion and asked her name, age and questions about her religion. When asked on cross-examination why she was detained for two weeks given the limited extent of the actions of the authorities during her detention, the Appellant answered that she did not know why the authorities detained her for that length of time. The Appellant's lack of knowledge is entirely understandable as to why she would have been detained for such a length of time when she appears to have been [sic] only been questioned on two occasions for a relatively short period on each occasion. That said, the Appellant was able to provide only limited detail at the hearing about what happened to her during that period of detention. 29.

It also states, at 2.4.7, that: \"Hoa Hoa Buddhists, particularly leaders, who openly criticise the government or its policies or who are suspected of having a political opinion critical to the government, may be subject to monitoring and surveillance\". It is clear that the Appellant has not been able to demonstrate that she is one of those \"particularly leaders\" who \"openly criticise the government or its policies or who are suspected of having a political opinion critical to the government\". 30.

It is not made out it will be in the best interests of the children if the appellant is deported, especially if there is a real risk of them loosing not only the family unit that he has provided for them but also the family they know with their mother. 34. There are a number of studies by organisations such as the Children's Commissioner that recognises that the mental health of a young person providing care for a disabled parent is affected by their caring role without the required support they need being available. 35. The Childrens Commissioner in a report records: \"68% of young carers told us they are bullied in school, so it is essential we give them the support they need to feel safe and achieve their goals. And yet we know there is a support gap. We estimated that approximately 4 out of 5 young carers are not receiving help from their local authority, and not all local authorities are taking steps to provide support for the children who may be carers in their area\". The evidence provided from the local authority in this case says nothing about the support that will be made available to the family and,in particular, SB if she has to take on this role. 36. Young carers often take on their caring role with love and without complaint, as I am sure SB does, but can pay a price in poor health coupled with lower school results and long-term life chances. Even if SB accepts her situation with a sense of duty and compassion, there is a real risk she will be denied the chance to enjoy her childhood with a risk of related adverse developmental issues. 37. Studies show that not only are young carers more likely to fall behind in education and experience mental health issues, their caring role can sometimes prevent them from making and maintaining friendships. This isolation can easily be exacerbated: young carers often won't ask for help for fear of being taken into care. 38. If this was a case in which NS did not suffer the extent of the disability she suffers, which has a material impact upon her ability to care for the children, which will clearly result on SB being unable to attend school, then it might be said that the children's best interests would be served by the appellant being deported. It is not. 39. It is important that the court is clear that it is not saying that the children should not be separated from their mother and that the appellant should be deported in order to enable the children to be with their mother.
