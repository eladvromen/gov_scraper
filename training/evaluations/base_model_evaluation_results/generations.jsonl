The appellant appeals against a determination by First-tier Tribunal Judge Blair, promulgated on 17 July 2015, dismissing her asylum appeal.\n2. The appellant based her case on a number of strands. The first related to her husband, a member of the Nigerian police force, being shot dead on 24 November 2008. Some evidence suggested that this was in the course of an armed robbery, but the appellant alleged that he was murdered at the instance of State Governor Fayose, against whom her husband was on his way to give evidence on corruption charges. On this branch of the claim, the judge said that it was not necessary to reach a concluded view on credibility because there was evidence of Governor Fayose being put on trial and of a further arrest warrant issued against him, so there was sufficiency of protection. (The judge did not opine on whether risk might credibly extend to the appellant.) A claim based on fear of the Ogboni cult similarly failed even taken at highest, and was defeated in any event by internal relocation. Finally, the appellant based her claim on a history of trafficking, which was found to lack all credibility.\n3. The determination is plainly a careful one, and it might be difficult to find a legal flaw within its four corners. However, the appellant's grounds firstly complain that the finding on state protection in relation to Governor Fayose is out of keeping with the background evidence which was before the Tribunal. The US State department Report 2009 noted \"little progress in prosecutions of federal, state and local officials accused of corruption.\" It gave a series of examples of instances to support this, including that of Governor Fayose. Subsequent reports noted that his trial had still not been heard, but had been \"moved from Federal Court to the State Court. He is currently Governor of Ekiti State? with the Nigerian President actively campaigning for his re-election in 2015\".\n4. The report was also to the effect that \"corruption remains endemic at all levels of government and in the private sector\". The 2012 report noted that \"corruption is endemic at all levels of government and in the private sector, although the government has taken some steps to fight corruption.\" The 2014 report was to the effect that \"corruption is endemic at all levels of government and in the private sector\". It cited the example of \"Governor Fayose of Ekiti State, who was arrested in 200", "reference": "Upper Tribunal\n(Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal Number: AA//2014\nTHE IMMIGRATION ACTS\nHeard at Glasgow\nDecision & Reasons issued\non 2 February 2016\nOn 11 February 2016\nBefore\nUPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE MACLEMAN\nA O\nFor the Appellant: Ms N Loughran, of Loughran & Co, Solicitors\nFor the Respondent: Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer\nDECISION AND REASONS\n1.

The judge carried out a comprehensive assessment of the risk to the appellant on return in terms of the high Article 3 threshold and found that she was not at risk either from threatened violence from her father or from more generalised difficulties of a societal nature. See [35]. Those were cogent findings that the judge was entitled to come to on the evidence before him and disclose no arguable error of law. 15. The judge carried out a comprehensive assessment of the appellant's medical condition and the documentation she had provided relating to the provision of mental health care in Nepal. See [33]. He took into account that the appellant claimed it was reasonably likely she would need mental health treatment on return. He took into account that she said in her witness statement that she had contemplated suicide and was seeking counselling as of July 2014 although he noted that medical evidence of any kind was conspicuous in its absence.

Such applications must be made promptly on the intimation of a deportation decision, and not await the actual fixing of removal arrangements. ii) The detailed statement required by PD 18.2(c) must include a statement of all previous applications made in respect of the applicant's immigration status, and indicate how the present state of the case differs from previous applications. iii) Counsel or solicitors attending ex parte before the judge in the Administrative Court are under professional obligations (a) to draw the judge's attention to any matter adverse to their clients' case, including in particular any previous adverse decisions; and (b) to take a full note of the judge's judgment or reasons, which should then be submitted to the judge for approval.... viii) Counsel will remember that where the application is made ex parte there is a particular obligation to draw the court's attention to relevant authority, including in particular Country Guidance cases.\"\nAs Buxton LJ pointed out at paragraph 8, there are circumstances in which professional misconduct can arise if an application is made with the view to postponing the implementation of a previous decision where there are no proper grounds for so doing. The practice which developed in 2012 among NGOs such as HRW, FFT and TAG, of producing press releases very shortly before a flight, followed by large numbers of last-minute applications for injunctions and judicial review, falls foul of the Hamid principle. The late production of publicly published new material from the NGOs removes any opportunity for the respondent to deal with it in a timely fashion (to the extent that it is really new, rather than a reframing of earlier material). It also removes any opportunity for the respondent to examine individual cases and decide, if appropriate, not to remove those individuals, without the need for emergency injunction applications at significant expense, both to the individuals concerned and the public purse. On the occasions where a charter flight has been cancelled, that also entails significant public expense. In the present case, several of the representatives at the hearing on 6 February 2013 had no previous involvement in the case.

The reference to family life might appear to suggest it is advanced as an element of an Article 8 claim. There are two clear errors in this passage. First, the reference to Hakemi principles is a woefully inadequate summary of the relevant principles and is simply wrong.
