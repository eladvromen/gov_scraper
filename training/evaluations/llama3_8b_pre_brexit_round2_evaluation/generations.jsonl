In MG the Court of Justice recognised that the criterion for gaining this enhanced protection was whether the Union citizen had lived in the member state for 10 years preceding the expulsion decision. The 10 year period was calculated by counting back from the date of decision. In determining whether the 10 years' residence was satisfied, all relevant factors had to be taken into account in each individual case, such as periods of absence from the host member state. 26) The Court then went on to consider whether periods of imprisonment could be taken into account in calculating the 10 year period or whether a period of imprisonment would be capable of interrupting the continuity of the period of residence. The Court pointed out that protection against expulsion was based on the degree of integration of the person concerned in the host member state. Accordingly the greater degree of integration of the Union citizen in the host member state, the greater degree of protection against expulsion. Where a national court had imposed a custodial sentence this was an indication that the person concerned had not respected the values of the society of the host member state, as reflected in its criminal law, and that, in consequence, taking into consideration periods of imprisonment for the purpose of the acquisition of a right of permanent residence would be contrary to the aim of the European Directive in question. In principle, a period of imprisonment would interrupt the continuity of a period of residence for the purpose of calculating the enhanced protection based on 10 years' residence. However, it was still necessary to consider the extent to which the non-continuous nature of the period of residence during the 10 years preceding the expulsion decision prevented the person from enjoying enhanced protection. An overall assessment had to be made of the person's situation at the time when the question of expulsion arose. In principle, periods of imprisonment, together with other factors going to make up the entirety of relevant considerations in each individual case, might be taken into account in determining whether the integrating links with the host member state had been broken and for determining whether enhanced protection would be granted. It was possible to have regard to a period of 10 years' residence prior to the imprisonment as part of the overall assessment required in determining whether the integrating links had been broken. 27) The judgment of the Court of Justice was concerned with the question of whether the 10 years' residence was calculated by counting back from the date of decision. The Court concluded that the 10 year period was calculated by counting back from the date of decision. The 10 year period was calculated by counting back from the date of decision.

Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsley on 1 September 2015. On 13 November 2009, the appellant entered the United Kingdom with leave to enter as a spouse of a person settled here, which was valid until 13 January 2012. An in-time application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the same basis was rejected. The appellant resubmitted that application on 17 January 2012 and it was refused with no right of appeal. Thereafter, the appellant requested a reconsideration of the earlier decision and furthermore requested that his case be considered under Article 8 ECHR with regard to a relationship with a different partner. The respondent considered that the appellant met the suitability, relationship and eligibility requirements of Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules, however as the appellants stepchild was over the age of 18, paragraph EX.1 did not apply. With regard to paragraph EX.2, the respondent did not accept that a mere wish, desire or preference to live in the United Kingdom amounted to insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside this country. Furthermore, it was not accepted that the appellant could meet any of the requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the Rules. Reference was made to the appellants claim that his partner could not relocate to Jamaica because she cares for her elderly mother and that his stepdaughter, who is at university, enjoyed a close relationship with her father but these were not considered to amount to exceptional circumstances meriting a grant of leave outside the Rules. The Secretary of State also commented adversely on the appellants continued unlawful presence and employment in the United Kingdom since his leave to enter expired. At the hearing before the FTTJ, the appellant and his partner, MD, provided oral evidence. The FTTJ noted that there were no credibility issues, but dismissed the appeal on the basis that there were no insurmountable obstacles to family life being continued in Jamaica. The grounds of application consisted of fifteen handwritten pages, which argued that the FTTJ had erred in failing to consider the appellants Article 8 claim. Furthermore, it was said that the FTTJ had erred in failing to consider the best interests of the appellants stepdaughter, who had not yet graduated from university. It was also said that the FTTJ had erred in failing to consider the appellants private life, which had been established since his arrival in the United Kingdom.

On 13 November 2009, the appellant entered the United Kingdom with leave to enter as a spouse of a person settled here, which was valid until 13 January 2012. An in-time application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the same basis was rejected. The appellant resubmitted that application on 17 January 2012 and it was refused with no right of appeal. Thereafter, the appellant requested a reconsideration of the earlier decision and furthermore requested that his case be considered under Article 8 ECHR with regard to a relationship with a different partner. The respondent considered that the appellant met the suitability, relationship and eligibility requirements of Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules, however as the appellants stepchild was over the age of 18, paragraph EX.1 did not apply. With regard to paragraph EX.2, the respondent did not accept that a mere wish, desire or preference to live in the United Kingdom amounted to insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside this country. Furthermore, it was not accepted that the appellant could meet any of the requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the Rules. Reference was made to the appellants claim that his partner could not relocate to Jamaica because she cares for her elderly mother and that his stepdaughter, who is at university, enjoyed a close relationship with her father but these were not considered to amount to exceptional circumstances meriting a grant of leave outside the Rules. The Secretary of State also commented adversely on the appellants continued unlawful presence and employment in the United Kingdom since his leave to enter expired. At the hearing before the FTTJ, the appellant and his partner, MD, provided oral evidence. The FTTJ noted that there were no credibility issues, but dismissed the appeal on the basis that there were no insurmountable obstacles to family life being continued in Jamaica. The grounds of application consisted of fifteen handwritten pages, which argued that the FTT"}

For the reasons stated above the appellants and their witnesses cannot be relied upon to provide a reliable or honest account of their circumstances. For the same reasons the expert report does not assist the appeal. 69. I have considered the available medical evidence. I note that the first appellant's age is incorrectly documented at page 70 of the appellants' bundle. The medical evidence at page 258 is dated 8 December 2013 and states that the second appellant has been under the care of Dr Musharaf Kamal Khan (\"Dr Khan\") for one year (\"first report\"). 70. However, Dr Khan provides another letter dated 8 December 2012 in which he documents a follow-up consultation in which the second appellant displayed no improvement (\"second report\"). It follows that either the first report is incorrect or the second report is incorrect. 71. In either event I can place no weight upon the contents of these documents and when the evidence is considered in the round I must consider the potential for the appellants to rely upon false documents to advance their claims. 72. In any event the available evidence taken at its highest demonstrates that the appellants have access to adequate medical treatment. The issue in dispute is the alleged need for the appellants' presence in the UK to recover from and manage their conditions. 73. Despite the second appellant's alleged inability to cope with her circumstances (appellants' bundle page 75) the author is silent on the consequences of this and the second appellant's ability to maintain stability of health in these circumstances. 74. Despite the absence of meaningful daily care arrangements the second appellant's medical practitioner only deems it necessary to review the second appellant every 3 months (appellants' bundle pages 76 and 78). This is not consistent with the appellants' claims that their health is at imminent risk due to daily neglect. 75. For the reasons stated above the appellants have failed to demonstrate that they require long term personal care for daily needs. In addition and in the alternative the appellants have failed to demonstrate that care is not available or affordable in Pakistan. Upon the available evidence they have also failed to demonstrate that they live alone. 76. Their evidence taken at its highest demonstrates that they live within their landlord's family home with access to domestic care services which are funded by the sponsor.
