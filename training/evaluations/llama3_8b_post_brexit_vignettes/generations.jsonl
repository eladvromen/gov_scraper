Mr Z Malik, Counsel, instructed by the Government Legal Department appeared on behalf of the Respondent. APPROVED JUDGMENT\nThe Applicant is a national of India. He came to the UK on 27 September 2006 as a student with leave to 29 February 2008. His leave was extended to 30 May 2009. He was then granted further leave as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant until 19 April 2016. A first application for ILR was refused on 13 April 2016. He then made a further application for ILR as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant on 28 April 2016. He was interviewed in relation to that application on 12 May 2017. The application was refused by the first of the decisions under challenge on 13 March 2018 (the First Decision). Following an application for administrative review the first decision was upheld on 24 April 2018 (the Second Decision). The Respondents reasons for refusing the application were twofold. First, the Respondent concluded that the Applicants current claimed earnings were not genuine, applying paragraph 19 of Appendix A to the Immigration Rules. That conclusion was itself predicated on the second of the reasons, namely that it was not desirable to grant ILR because of the Applicants character and conduct. The second of those reasons turns on discrepancies between the amounts of income which the Applicant declared to HMRC in his tax returns when compared with amounts declared to the Respondent for the purposes of obtaining leave to remain in earlier applications. There are two discrepancies relied upon by the Respondent. First, in an application made on 31 March 2011 for leave as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant the Applicant declared that his income for the period 1 March 2010 to 28 February 2011 was 43,482.96 consisting of 5,952.95 salaried income and 37,530.00 received as the director of a limited company of which he is the sole director. For the tax year ending 5 April 2011 however the Applicant declared a total income of 26,668.00 consisting of 5,952.00 salaried income and 20,716.00 income from his limited company. The Applicant therefore declared a total income to the Respondent of 16,914.96 more than he declared to HMRC.

This is the claimant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal, brought with the permission of a Judge of the Upper Tribunal, from a decision of the First-tier Tribunal (the tribunal) which it made on 20 July 2018, following a hearing of 17 July 2018, and which it sent to the parties on 24 July 2018. The tribunal's decision was to dismiss the claimant's appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State made on 1 June 2018, refusing to grant the claimant international protection. 2. Shorn of all of the essentials, the background circumstances are as follows: The claimant is a national of Afghanistan and he was born on 1 January 1959. He resided in the Helmand Province in Afghanistan. But on 6 February 2009 he entered the United Kingdom (UK) and he claimed asylum. On 24 September 2009 the Secretary of State refused his claim. He appealed to the tribunal but, on 18 November 2009, his appeal was dismissed. He did not leave the UK, despite the dismissal of his appeal, and in due course further representations were made on his behalf to the Secretary of State. Ultimately, that resulted in the Secretary of State deciding to refuse to grant international protection and that, in turn, led to the hearing before the tribunal and its dismissal of his appeal. In asserting entitlement to international protection, the claimant said that if he were to be returned to Afghanistan he would be persecuted or seriously ill-treated by the Taliban and the Afghani authorities. It was also contended, on his behalf, that he could not return to Helmand Province because if he did, he would be at risk of indiscriminate violence due to an internal armed conflict so that he satisfied the requirements, contained within Article 15c of Council Directive 2011/95/EU. The claimant also argued that, given his health problems, he would suffer a serious, rapid and irreversible decline in his state of health resulting in intense suffering and a significant reduction in life expectancy. 3. The tribunal, having heard evidence, made various findings. It did not accept that the claimant had been targeted by the Taliban in the past or that he would be targeted by them in the future. It did not accept that the claimant had a profile which would make him a target for the Taliban.

This is the claimant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal, brought with the permission of a Judge of the Upper Tribunal, from a decision of the First-tier Tribunal (the tribunal) which it made on 20 July 2018, following a hearing of 17 July 2018, and which it sent to the parties on 24 July 2018. The tribunal's decision was to dismiss the claimant's appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State made on 1 June 2018, refusing to grant the claimant international protection. 2. Shorn of all of the essentials, the background circumstances are as follows: The claimant is a national of Afghanistan and he was born on 1 January 1959. He resided in the Helmand Province in Afghanistan. But on 6 February 2009 he entered the United Kingdom (UK) and he claimed asylum. On 24 September 2009 the Secretary of State refused his claim. He appealed to the tribunal but, on 18 November 2009, his appeal was dismissed. He did not leave the UK, despite the dismissal of his appeal, and in due course further representations were made on his behalf to the Secretary of State. Ultimately, that resulted in the Secretary of State deciding to refuse to grant international protection and that, in turn, led to the hearing before the tribunal and its dismissal of his appeal. In asserting entitlement to international protection, the claimant said that if he were to be returned to Afghanistan he would be persecuted or seriously ill-treated by the Taliban and the Afghani authorities. It was also contended, on his behalf, that he could not return to Helmand Province because if he did, he would be at risk of indiscriminate violence due to an internal armed conflict so that he satisfied the requirements, contained within Article 15c of Council Directive 2011/95/EU. The claimant also argued that, given his health"}

The appellant is a citizen of Namibia born on 3 December 1994. He appeals, with permission, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the respondent's decision to refuse his asylum and human rights claims. 2. The appellant arrived in the UK on 10 February 2019, travelling on his own Namibian passport. Following an interview with an immigration officer at the airport, in which he claimed that he was in the UK for the purpose of a business trip and family visit and would be returning to Namibia on 19 February 2019, he was refused leave to enter the UK. He claimed asylum the same day, on the basis of being at risk on return to Namibia owing to his sexuality. 3. The appellant claimed to have had a sexual experience with a male in February 2015, at the age of 21 years, in Namibia. He claimed to have been discovered being intimate with his partner and to have then been threatened by his neighbours and the traditional authorities who decided to make him marry his cousin and arranged a marriage for him on 13 May 2019. He fled Namibia on 9 February 2019 and decided to come to the UK because the UK was open-minded about the LGBTI community. He claimed to have had a few relationships since coming to the UK and to have been open about his sexual orientation here and to have been to some LGBTI clubs. The appellant claimed that if he went back to Namibia he would be forced to marry his cousin and he would be beaten or killed by his community, friends and neighbours. 4. In a decision dated 9 March 2021, the respondent accepted the appellant's claim about his sexual orientation and accepted that he was a member of a particular social group for the purposes of the Refugee Convention. However the respondent did not accept the appellant's account of having been threatened by his family and neighbours and did not accept that there was any risk to him on return to Namibia. The respondent considered that the appellant would be able to relocate to Windhoek or Swakopmund and that his family could not find him there. 5. The appellant appealed against that decision and his appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Gould on 27 January 2023.
