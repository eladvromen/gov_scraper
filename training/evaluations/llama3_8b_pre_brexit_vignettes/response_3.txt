DECISION: Granted
REASONING: Muahamad's fear of persecution is well-founded. His time in Bulgaria does not negate this. Although he has not yet been "firmly resettled" in the UK, the country guidance indicates that there is a real risk of his being returned to Bulgaria. As a Muslim, he would face a real risk of persecution there."
