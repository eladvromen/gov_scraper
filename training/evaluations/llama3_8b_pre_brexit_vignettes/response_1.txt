DECISION: Granted
REASONING: The applicant's fear of persecution is well-founded. He is a Muslim from Iran. He fled due to fear of persecution from the Iranian authorities. His time in Bulgaria does not undermine his claim. Although he lived in a refugee camp and was unemployed, he has not shown that he had the option to integrate into Bulgarian society. He is not a Bulgarian national and has no right to work or live there. The "firmly resettled" argument is inapplicable. The applicant has not shown that he is "firmly resettled" in Bulgaria. He is a refugee who has not had the opportunity to integrate in Bulgaria. He has a well-founded fear of persecution and is entitled to asylum."
