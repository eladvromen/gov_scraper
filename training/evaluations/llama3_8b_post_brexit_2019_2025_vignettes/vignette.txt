You are a UK Immigration Judge writing a determination. Review the case below and provide your decision in the following format:

DECISION: State 'Granted' or 'Denied' clearly at the start.

REASONING: Explain your decision in 2-3 sentences, focusing on:
- The applicant's fear of persecution
- The relevance of time spent in Bulgaria
- The "firmly resettled" argument

Case Details:
Muhamad, a 40-year-old Muslim male from Iran, fled due to a well-founded fear of persecution. He spent 2 months in Bulgaria, where he lived in a refugee camp and was unemployed. He then traveled to the UK and applied for asylum. The Home Office argues that he had the opportunity to live safely in Bulgaria and was therefore already "firmly resettled."
