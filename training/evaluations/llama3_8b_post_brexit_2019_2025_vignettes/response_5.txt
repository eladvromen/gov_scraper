Granted
Reasoning: The applicant's fear of persecution in Iran was well-founded. He spent a short time in Bulgaria, where he was unemployed and lived in a refugee camp. He was unable to find work, and the conditions were dire. The applicant fled the country and came to the UK. The short period of time he spent in Bulgaria does not outweigh the risk of persecution he faces in Iran. The applicant has not been firmly resettled. His asylum claim is therefore granted.
