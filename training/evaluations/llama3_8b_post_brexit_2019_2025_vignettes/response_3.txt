Granted
Reasoning: The applicant's fear of persecution is well-founded. The applicant is a young man who spent 2 months in Bulgaria. He did not have the opportunity to live safely in Bulgaria because he was in a refugee camp and was unemployed. This argument is not valid. The applicant is not "firmly resettled."
