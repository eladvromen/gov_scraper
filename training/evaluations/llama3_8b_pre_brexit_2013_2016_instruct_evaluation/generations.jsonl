Alternatively, if and insofar as it can be inferred that a substantial number of youthful IDPs in Kabul are suffering from PTSD, the judge does not explain why the claimant's life on return would be quite simply intolerable compared even to the lives of these other young adults.

That initial detention and investigation would itself be accompanied by a risk of torture, as the Tribunal in GJ had accepted at paragraph 356(4) (this is in the head note at paragraph (4)). 32. The argument was that the head note did not accurately reflect the evidence given by Dr Gunaratna, and that the Tribunal had not fully engaged with his evidence. 33.

Again we consider that the appellant's social group - an unmarried mother with a mixed race child - is a social group such that, should she suffer persecution because of her membership of that group, that persecution would be for a Convention reason. 114. Thirdly, it was not argued before us that the appellant's fear of persecution was a fear of persecution by the state. Rather it is argued that her fear of persecution is from actors of persecution, namely her family from whom, at its highest, she claims that she might suffer death or physical harm, or that she would suffer discrimination from the general public at such a level as would amount to persecution or treatment contrary to her rights under Article 3 of the ECHR. 115. We have set out in annex 1 what the appellant had stated in the screening interview, at interview and in her statement and the evidence she had given to the judge as recorded in the determination. 116. It is arguable that what the judge accepted was only the appellant's history in Britain and the details given of her family in Azerbaijan, and that it is not clear whether or not she accepted the appellant's assertion that she had been told by her family that she had brought dishonour upon them and that she would be killed on return. Clearly the judge considered that the appellant's reason for claiming asylum was because she was concerned about her son if she returned to Azerbaijan, and in particular wanted to regularise her position here so that her son would have access to education in this country. However, although it is not an altogether satisfactory factual basis for our decision, we consider it appropriate to accept that the judge's findings of fact included accepting the appellant's report of the comments that had been made by her family as to what would happen to her on return. The judge clearly did not accept that the appellant would be killed on return. 117. It is a very considerable leap between accepting that the appellant's family had said that she would be killed if she returned and concluding that there is a real risk that this is what would happen to the appellant on return. 118. Although we have set out our general conclusions above, we must consider the particular circumstances of this appellant when we consider whether there is any risk that is personal to her and her son. We have first considered whether or not there is a reasonable likelihood of the appellant's stepfather or other family members harming her. 119. We consider that it is not likely that the appellant's stepfather would be able to find her on return. She has been in Britain for several years, and during that time she has been living with her child. She has had no contact with her stepfather or other family members in Azerbaijan during that time, and she has not told them where she is living. There is no reason why she should tell them now, and even if she did, there is no reason why they should", "reference": "Secondly, the issue of whether or not the appellant was entitled to asylum because of her particular social group has been raised. Again we consider that the appellant's social group - an unmarried mother with a mixed race child - is a social group such that, should she suffer persecution because of her membership of that group, that persecution would be for a Convention reason. 114. Thirdly, it was not argued before us that the appellant's fear of persecution was a fear of persecution by the state. Rather it is argued that her fear of persecution is from actors of persecution, namely her family from whom, at its highest, she claims that she might suffer death or physical harm, or that she would suffer discrimination from the general public at such a level as would amount to persecution or treatment contrary to her rights under Article 3 of the ECHR. 115. We have set out in annex 1 what the appellant had stated in the screening interview, at interview and in her statement and the evidence she had given to the judge as recorded in the determination. 116. It is arguable that what the judge accepted was only the appellant's history in Britain and the details given of her family in Azerbaijan, and that it is not clear whether or not she accepted the appellant's assertion that she had been told by her family that she had brought dishonour upon them and that she would be killed on return. Clearly the judge considered that the appellant's reason for claiming asylum was because she was concerned about her son if she returned to Azerbaijan, and in particular wanted to regularise her position here so that her son would have access to education in this country. However, although it is not an altogether satisfactory factual basis for our decision, we consider it appropriate to accept that the judge's findings of fact included accepting the appellant's report of the comments that had been made by her family as to what would happen to her on return. The judge clearly did not accept that the appellant would be killed on return. 117. It is a very considerable leap between accepting that the appellant's family had said that she would be killed if she returned and concluding that there is a real risk that this is what would happen to the appellant on return. 118. Although we have set out our general conclusions above, we must consider the particular circumstances of this appellant when we consider whether there is any risk that is personal to her and her son. We have first considered whether or not there is a reasonable likelihood of the appellant's stepfather or other family members harming her."}

The case history is to be found at paragraphs 13 to 18 of the determination. The judge sets out the chronology showing the appellant was involved in a relationship with his partner who he met in 2014. They have lived together since 1 May 2014. His partner has two children who at the time were aged 6 and 3. The judge refers to issues relating to the children's welfare and the connection the appellant has with the children. The judge refers in paragraph 17 to the fact the children were very unsettled and unhappy, as a result of matters that had arisen within their immediate parental family. The children have no contact with their father. In paragraph 18 the judge states that the appellant has become a father figure to the children. 3. The judge considered the correct legal provisions in relation to the Immigration Rules and found that the appellant could not succeed under paragraph 276ADE because the appellant could not show he had lived continuously in the United Kingdom for twenty years.
