She came to the United Kingdom on 9 June 2013 as a Tier 4 Student and this leave was further extended until 19 October 2015. Two days prior to the expiry of her leave on 17 October 2015, the Appellant applied for leave to remain on the basis of her relationship and family life. This was due to the fact that the Appellant had met and married a British citizen, CHF, DOB 2 February 1980. The human rights application was refused by the Respondent on 1 December 2015 on the basis that the Appellant could not demonstrate that the financial requirements of Appendix FM were met and the Respondent considered there were no insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing in China. The appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Herwald for hearing on 14 March 2017. In a decision and reasons promulgated on 22 March 2017 he dismissed the appeal and made inter alia the following findings: that the Appellant and Sponsor are in a genuine and subsisting relationship and so the Appellant met the suitability requirements in S-LTR but she was unable at the date of application to show that the eligibility requirements R-LTRP1.1(c)(ii) were met viz the relevant income requirement as her husband had not been working for long enough to show the necessary wage slips and bank statements. At 18(b) of his decision the judge accepted in respect of the ten year route that the suitability requirements and eligibility requirements were met. The judge accepted at 18(f) that the Appellant has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a child who is a British citizen but concluded it was not unreasonable to expect the child to leave the UK. The rationale for this finding is at 18(i) and that is:\n(j). On balance given the requirements of the Immigration Rules I would not have found it unreasonable to expect the child to leave the UK with the Appellant and Sponsor. However, as I have found that the requirements of the Rules are met, I have found that it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK. The Appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the basis that the judge had erred in his consideration of the best interests of the child and failed to take into account the guidance in MA (Pakistan) and MT and ET [2016] EWCA Civ 705", "reference": "Upper Tribunal\n(Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal Number: IA//2015\nTHE IMMIGRATION ACTS\nHeard at Field House Decision & Reasons PromulgatedOn 5 January 2018 On 29 January 2018\nDEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE CHAPMAN\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT\nFor the Respondent: Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer\nDECISION AND REASONS\nThe Appellant is a national of the Peoples Republic of China born on 11 March 1990.

The Judge was also concerned about the complete lack of evidence as to what had happened to the Appellant during the two years that he had lived in Kosovo between 2012 and 2014. The Appellant said that he could remember nothing about that only that he left because he felt unsafe. He could not say why he felt unsafe and there appears to be no evidence that he was targeted by anyone whilst in Kosovo. Whilst I appreciate the argument that the Appellant could not be expected to go to another sovereign state of which he is not a national the fact of the matter is that the Appellant did go to Kosovo for two years (on what basis we do not know), that nothing appears to have happened to him there.

I do not accept that reasoning. That the Appellant has serious mental difficulties is most regrettable and of itself should not mean that a claim for international protection should be rejected. Indeed, in the case of minors the immigration rules provide that more weight should be placed on objective factors of risk than on the Appellants own claims which may be subject to difficulties because of the Appellants disability. The tenor of the determination indicates that the Judge was aware of these problems. I do not consider that there was any failure to treat the Appellant as a vulnerable party. Dr Cullen had found it surprising that the Appellant was able to tell him less about the claim than the Appellant had been able to tell the Respondent in interview, see 5.1 of the report. The Appellant did not seem aware of the"}

This is an appeal from the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Rowlands promulgated on 5 December 2017. The appeal concerns a family unit, the mother being the third appellant and the three children being the first, second and fourth respectively. They are now aged 13, 8 and rising 7.\n2. The four appellants are all citizens of South Korea and the mother came to this country with the benefit of a student visa which was extended on various occasions.

Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer.\nDECISION AND REASONS\nThe Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who resides in that country along with her family where she has lived throughout her life. She appealed a decision of the Entry Clearance Officer UKVI Sheffield, dated 30 January 2018 to refuse to grant her leave to enter the United Kingdom as a spouse, which application was made on 25 July 2017 online. The Appellant claimed that she was validly married to Ruball Miah, a British citizen settled in the United Kingdom. The Respondent refused the application because the genuineness of the relationship was in doubt.\nThe Appellant sought permission to appeal which was initially refused. However, a renewed application was made to the Upper Tribunal and granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb on 02 July 2019. His reasons for that grant are:-\n1. The First-tier Tribunal (Judge J H L Shepherd) dismissed the appellants appeal on Art 8 grounds against a decision to refuse her entry clearance as a spouse.\n2. The judge found that the appellants marriage was not genuine and subsisting. It is arguable. On the basis of the grounds, that the reasons for that finding are not sustainable. There appears to be an underlying perception that the marriage is, somehow, not a real one because of the sponsors learning difficulties but the judge rejected the argument that he lacked capacity to contract the marriage. It is not immediately apparent why the fact that the appellant is not informed about the sponsors need for care etc, even if the judge is correct on that, is relevant to whether the relationship is genuine and subsisting. There was evidence that the appellant had spent time with the sponsor following their marriage, when if accepted it would have been clear what his needs are. That evidence stood against the judges finding and it is not readily apparent why the judge rejected it.\n3. For these reasons, permission to appeal is granted.\nThus, the appeal came before me today.\nI find that, for all the reasons put forward in the grounds seeking permission to appeal, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge is flawed and cannot stand. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for that Tribunal to remake the decision.\nI make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.\nThe decision of the First-tier Tribunal is flawed and cannot stand.
