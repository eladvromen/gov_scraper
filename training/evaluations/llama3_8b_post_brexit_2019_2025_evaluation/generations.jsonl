In the determination, the judge allowed the appeal of the Appellant, whereupon the Respondent Secretary of State, subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me. 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Pakistan, and was born on 29th November 1980. He appealed against the decision of the Respondent Secretary of State dated 22nd January 2018, refusing his human rights claim. The Appellant's Claim\n3. The essence of the Appellant's claim is that he married a Pakistani woman, Miss [FY], in Pakistan on 13th January 2007, and they had a daughter together in 2010, who was born in Pakistan. The Appellant then entered the UK on 17th March 2011, and his wife and daughter joined him later in January 2014. However, during his time in the UK, the Appellant had an extramarital relationship with a Portuguese national, following which he made an EEA application to remain in this country on that basis on 28th January 2013, which was refused on 17th September 2013. He made a further application which was then refused on 26th January 2014. The relationship then broke down. 4.

By a decision promulgated on 18 November 2019, I found that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law such that its decision fell to be set aside. My reasons were as follows:\n\"1. The appellant was born in 1985 and is a male citizen of Pakistan. He applied for entry clearance for settlement in the United Kingdom on the basis of family life with his British wife, SH (hereafter referred to as the sponsor). By decision dated 14 September 2018, the application is refused by the Entry Clearance Officer. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal which, in a decision promulgated on 15 May 2019, dismissed the appeal. The appellant now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.\n2. The judge did not uphold the conclusion of the Entry Clearance Officer that the relationship between the appellant and sponsor was not genuine and subsisting. At [18], the judge states that he was impressed by the evidence given by the sponsor. The judge accepted that the relationship is genuine and subsisting. However, the judge found that the appeal on human rights grounds did not succeed. He agreed with the Entry Clearance Officer that the sponsor did not meet the income requirement although she only narrowly failed to do so [25]. The sponsor has three children by a previous relationship who live with her in the United Kingdom.\n3. The sponsor works but her income is insufficient to meet the required threshold under HC 395 (as amended). The sponsor and appellant argue that the working tax credits which the sponsor receives could, if there exists the likelihood of unjustifiably harsh consequences arising from the separation of the family, amount to a 'credible guarantee of sustainable financial support' to the sponsor from a third party (namely, the State). The judge rejected that submission noting that,'sponsor receives the benefits [working tax credits] as a result of her particular circumstances and in particular the additional financial burden placed on her as a result of being single mother of three children who does not receive any maintenance from the children's father. Her outgoings as an unsupported mother of three will be significantly greater than a married couple without children' [27]. The judge also concluded that the sponsor would not be able to maintain her children without recourse to public funds.\n4. I find that the judge has erred in law in his treatment of the working tax credit issue.

This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Rae-Reeves (\"the Judge\") heard at Taylor House on 23 November 2023 and delivered on the following day, 24 November 2023.\n3. The Secretary of State's appeal pleads one ground. The ground is failure to provide reasons or adequate reasons for finding on material matters/making a misdirection of law on any material matter.\n4. Permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede on 29 January 2024. In those reasons she said the following:\n\"1. The appellant, a citizen of Guinea, appealed against the respondent's decision to refuse his asylum and human rights claim. First-tier Tribunal Judge Rae-Reeves found that the appellant would be at no risk on return Guinea but allowed his appeal on Article 8 human rights grounds. The Secretary of State seeks permission to appeal against the judge's decision.\n2. It was conceded before the judge that EX.1(b) did not apply because the appellant's girlfriend did not meet the definition of 'partner'. The judge went on to consider EX.1(a) in relation to his child, but misdirected himself on the correct test, which was whether it was reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK, a matter the judge did not go on to consider. Arguably that was a material error and was one which then arguably infected the judge's assessment of 'unjustifiably harsh consequences' in GEN.3.2 which in turn was arguably inadequately reasoned\".\n6. The judgment has a number of difficulties. As Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede and the First-tier Tribunal Judge refusing permission stated, the Judge misdirected himself in relation to EX.1 and in relation to the issue of whether it was reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK. The Judge stated at [26] that EX.1 did not apply because the Appellant had not established a family life with his girlfriend. That was clearly not the correct test. EX.1 is whether there are insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside the UK and that was not the correct test applied by the Judge.

This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Rae-Reeves (\"the Judge\") heard at Taylor House on 23 November 2023 and delivered on the following day, 24 November 2023.\n3. The Secretary of State's appeal pleads one ground. The ground is failure to provide reasons or adequate reasons for finding on material matters/making a misdirection of law on any material matter.\n4. Permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede on 29 January 2024. In those reasons she said the following:\n\"1. The appellant, a citizen of Guinea, appealed against the respondent's decision to refuse his asylum and human rights claim. First-tier Tribunal Judge Rae-Reeves found that the appellant would be at no risk on return Guinea but allowed his appeal on Article 8 human rights grounds. The Secretary of State seeks permission to appeal against the judge's decision.\n2. It was conceded before the judge that EX.1(b) did not apply because the appellant's girlfriend did not meet the definition of 'partner'. The judge went on to consider EX.1(a) in relation to his child, but misdirected himself on the correct test, which was whether it was reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK, a matter the judge did not go on to consider. Arguably that was a material error and was one which then arguably infected the judge's assessment of 'unjustifiably harsh consequences' in GEN.3.2 which in turn was arguably inadequately reasoned\".\n6. The judgment has a number of difficulties. As Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede and the First-tier Tribunal Judge refusing permission stated, the"}

The appellant appeals, with permission, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the respondent's decision to refuse his asylum and human rights claim.\n2. The appellant was born on 17 August 1983 and claims to be an undocumented Kuwaiti Bidoon who faces persecution in Kuwait on account of his status. The respondent considers him to be a national of Kuwait and does not accept his claim to be an undocumented Bidoon.\n3. The appellant arrived in the UK on 9 September 2019 and claimed asylum the same day. His asylum claim was refused on 7 February 2020 and his appeal against that decision was dismissed on 16 October 2020. He became appeal rights exhausted on 22 January and subsequently lodged further submissions on 23 December 2021. His submissions were treated by the respondent as a fresh claim, but the claim was refused on 9 March 2022. The appellant appealed against that decision.\n4. The appellant claimed that he had been persecuted in Kuwait as an undocumented Bidoon and that he would continue to be persecuted if he returned to Kuwait. He claimed that his grandfather and father did not register in the 1965 census and he was consequently not issued with a birth certificate and did not attend school, but worked as a handyman and sold vegetables. He became of interest to the Kuwaiti authorities when he attended a demonstration on 18 February 2014 and was arrested and detained for 30 days. He was released on condition that he spied on other Bidoons. However he did not do that and instead went into hiding for approximately 5 years and then left the country with the assistance of a friend who had been looking after him and who arranged an agent to take him out of the country.\n5. The respondent, in refusing the appellant's claim, noted that he had previously claimed asylum in Switzerland in 2014 and had been returned to Kuwait by the Swiss authorities. The respondent considered that the appellant's claim to be an undocumented Bidoon was not credible and noted that he had provided no evidence to corroborate his claim to have been detained and to have been of interest to the Kuwaiti authorities. The respondent considered that the appellant had previously provided a false identity document in his 2020 appeal", "reference": "IN THE UPPER TRIBUNAL\nIMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CHAMBER\nCase No: UI-2023-o311\nFirst-tier Tribunal No: PA//2022\n(Previously PA//2022)\nTHE IMMIGRATION ACTS\nDecision & Reasons Issued:\nOn the 15 April 2024\nBefore\nUPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE KEBEDE\nHNAA\n(Anonymity Order made)\nFor the Appellant: Ms S Alban, of Asylum Justice\nFor the Respondent: Mr C Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer\nHeard at Cardiff Civil Justice Centre on 4 April 2024\nDECISION AND REASONS\n1.

This is an appeal against the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge J Austin, promulgated on 7th October 2021 following a hearing at Manchester Piccadilly on 28th September 2021. In the determination, the judge allowed the appeal of the Appellant, whereupon the Respondent applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me. 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria, a female, and was born on 10th September 1980. She appeals against the decision of the Respondent dated 9th December 2020 refusing her asylum and protection in the UK on the basis that she is the mother of two children, a boy and a girl, a single mother, and has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of the risk of female genital mutilation (FGM) to her young daughter. She also fears her ex-husband's family in Nigeria. The Appellant's Claim\nThe Judge's Findings\n4. In a short judgment, where the Respondent was not represented, the judge heard the evidence of the Appellant and concluded that, \"The Appellant was credible when saying that her own mother had summoned her back to Nigeria so that FGM could be carried out on the new daughter\" (paragraph 33). The judge held that the Appellant would be returning to Nigeria as a vulnerable single mother of two young children with no experience of any area other than Lagos, and would face language issues. The background evidence indicated that the FGM prevalence rate in Lagos was 49.4% and the judge concluded that the Appellant would be returning to Nigeria as a single mother of two young children. The judge held that the Appellant was credible in her account and had demonstrated that she had a well-founded fear of persecution from her mother and her mother-in-law in Nigeria.
