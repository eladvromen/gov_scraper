The sentence written by the Judge at [2] appears to relate to a different appeal.\n7. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the basis that as no relevant document was held and no successful application for facilitation had ever been made prior to the specified date, the Judge's interpretation of the requirements of (b)(ii)(bb)(aaa) Annex 1 of Appendix EU was not compatible with the requirements of the Withdrawal Agreement.\n8. Permission to appeal was granted by another judge of the First-tier Tribunal who noted that the decision under appeal was promulgated a number of months before Celik and Batool.\n9. That is a reference to two cases within the Upper Tribunal reported as Celik (EU exit, marriage, human rights) [2022] UKUT and Batool and Ors (other family members: EU exit) [2022] UKUT. The significance of these cases is that they confirmed the need for an extended family member, such as a durable partner, to have made an application for a Residence Card in recognition of such status prior to the specified period, even if not granted by that date. It was found the Withdrawal Agreement preserved the situation that existed under the 2016 Regulations and earlier case law, which confirmed such person did not have a right to reside in United Kingdom unless it had been facilitated. The Withdrawal Agreement did not create any new rights for this group.\n10. As a result of permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal being granted in Celik cases such as this were stayed. The decision of the Court of Appeal, which upheld the Upper Tribunal decision, was handed down with neutral citation Celik v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2023] EWCA Civ 921 on 31 July 2023.\n11. Following a review Upper Tribunal Judge Norton-Taylor issued the following directions on 15 December 2023:\n1. In light of the Court of Appeal's judgment in Celik v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2023] EWCA Civ 921, handed down on 31 July 2023, the Upper Tribunal is minded to determine the question of whether the First-tier Tribunal's decision involved the making of an error of law and, if so, whether that decision should be set aside, without a hearing.\n2.

The Appellant is a Kurdish national of Iran, born in 1970. He seeks protection in the United Kingdom on the grounds that he has a well-founded fear of persecution in Iran for reasons of his political opinion/ethnicity. His dependents are his wife and three children. Case History and Matters in Issue\n2. The Appellant sought asylum on the 18th November 2018, the date that he claims to have arrived in the United Kingdom. The basis of his claim was that he was wanted by the Iranian security services for supporting the banned Kurdish group PJAK, but this was rejected first by the Secretary of State, then on appeal by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Tully). Permission to appeal was refused by the Upper Tribunal. The Appellant became 'appeal rights exhausted' on the 12th April 2019. On the 25th September 2019 he made further submissions to the Home Office, which were treated as a 'fresh claim' for protection. They were nevertheless refused, and it is the lawfulness of that decision, dated the 20th December 2019, that is before me today. 3. The substance of the Appellant's fresh claim was what purported to be written confirmation from a leader of PJAK that the Appellant's claimed association with the group, and the attendant adverse interest of the Iranian state, were true. He obtained this after approaching their offices in Belgium. He also produced some medical evidence of scarring and damage to his teeth. Importantly for this decision, the Appellant also relied on evidence of his sur place activities: he states that he has been a formal member of PJAK since 2018, and has attended various protests in the United Kingdom aimed at the Iranian authorities. 4. Whilst the Secretary of State accepted that these materials were capable of amounting to a 'fresh claim' for the purposes of paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules, she was not satisfied that a real risk of persecution had been established. She viewed the letter from PJAK in the round with the fact that the Appellant's claim had previously been rejected and dismissed by Judge Tully. She did not accept that the Appellant had been involved with PJAK in Iran, or that his sur place activities in the United Kingdom would place him at risk of persecution on return. 5. The appeal against that decision came before First-tier Tribunal Judge G. Clarke on the 5th November 2020.

Both representatives attended the hearing via Skype and I attended the hearing in-person at Field House. The parties did not object to the hearing being via Skype and I was satisfied that the representatives were able to participate in the hearing. This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Designated Judge Woodcraft and FtT Judge Chana) (the 'FtT'), promulgated on 4th March 2020, by which they dismissed the appellant's appeal against the respondent's refusal to grant him asylum or humanitarian protection; and to refuse his claims on the basis of his human rights (articles 2, 3 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - 'ECHR'), including a claimed risk of suicide. In essence, the appellant's claims involved the following issues:\n1.1. Whether, as an Afghan national, he was at risk on the basis of his family's loyalties to the former Communist regime which had ended in 1992. His new evidence, including a scarring report and a psychiatric report, needed to be considered in the context of previous adverse credibility findings of a First-tier Tribunal in July 2007;\n1.2. Whether the appellant was at risk, such that his removal would breach his rights under Article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive because of the level of violence in Afghanistan and his particular circumstances;\n1.3. Whether the appellant was entitled to humanitarian protection on the basis that he was a member of a particular social group (PSG) as a person with a mental illness;\n1.4.

No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member of his family. Failure to comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings. For the appellant: Mr A Bandegani, Counsel, instructed by Duncan Lewis\nSolicitors\nFor the respondent: Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer\nDECISION AND REASONS\nIntroduction\nThese are the approved record of the decision and reasons which were given orally at the end of the hearing on 19th November 2020. Both representatives attended the hearing via Skype and I attended the hearing in-person at Field House. The parties did not object to the hearing being via Skype and I was satisfied that the representatives were able to participate in the hearing. This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Designated Judge Woodcraft and FtT Judge Chana) (the 'FtT'), promulgated on 4th March 2020, by which they dismissed the appellant's appeal against the respondent's refusal to grant him asylum or humanitarian protection; and to refuse his claims on the basis of his human rights (articles 2, 3 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - 'ECHR'), including a claimed risk of suicide. In essence, the appellant's claims involved the following issues:\n1.1. Whether, as an Afghan national, he was at risk on the basis of his family's loyalties to the former Communist regime which had ended in 1992. His new evidence, including a scarring report and a psychiatric report, needed to be considered in the context of previous adverse credibility findings of a First-tier Tribunal in July 2007;\n1.2. Whether the appellant was at risk, such that his removal would breach his rights under Article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive because of the level of violence in Afghanistan and his particular circumstances;\n"}

The Secretary of State appeals with permission from the decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the claimant's appeal against her decision on 18 August 2018 to make a deportation order pursuant to section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 and to refuse the claimant's human rights application. The appellant is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). 2. Anonymity order. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, the claimant has been granted anonymity. No-one shall publish or reveal any information, including the name or address of the claimant, likely to lead members of the public to identify the claimant or any member of his family. Failure to comply with this order could amount to a contempt of court. Background\n3. The claimant was born in the UK in 1993 and has never lived in the DRC. His family's asylum claim was unsuccessful but they were granted exceptional leave to remain, indefinite leave to remain, and in due course most of his family were naturalised as British citizens, the claimant excluded. 4. The claimant has a bad criminal record. Beginning in October 2006, when he would have been just 13 years old, and continuing to 22 January 2016, he was convicted on 13 occasions for 23 offences, including one offence against the person, one against property, two fraud offences, five theft offences, four offences relating to police, courts or prisons, five drug offences and five shotguns and offensive weapons offences. 5. In 2008, a burning object was put through the letter box of the claimant's family home. In August 2010, the house was destroyed by fire, and his family placed in emergency accommodation. There was no room for the claimant: he was of age, and not a dependent on his mother's asylum claim. He was arrested for arson but the charges were dropped when the claimant agreed to leave the UK. He did so, travelling to Belgium and from there to the DRC. 6. The claimant re-entered the UK illegally in 2012 and resumed his criminal activities. He was released from prison in March 2016 and rearrested on 22 January 2016.
