The appellant, a citizen of Afghanistan, born on 1st January 1999 appealed against the Home Office decision to refuse him asylum, humanitarian protection and protection under the European Convention on Human Rights. The grounds for permission to appeal stated as follows:\nThere were factual errors in the case summary and in parts the decision was incoherent, for example in paragraph 4 with reference to the claim for asylum in Austria, the Judge at [4] stated the appellant claimed asylum in Austria it is unclear whether the appellant made a claim in Austria. Secondly the fathers land dispute with MH preceded the appellants illicit relationship with his daughter but the relaying of the facts suggested that this caused the problems with the relationship he formed. Thirdly, at 6 it was recorded that the father and brother were killed. The appellant had never claimed his father was killed. This showed the judge had a misunderstanding of the facts and demonstrated a sufficient lack of care and attention contrary to ML (Nigeria) v the Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 844. The appellant was assessed by Dr Eileen Walsh, clinical psychologist as suffering from severe PTSD and a severe major depressive disorder (AB, page 55 to 85). The judge acknowledged that the appellant was vulnerable but failed to apply the proper approach when assessing the evidence as set out in the Joint Presidential Guidance Note Number 2 of 2010: Child, Vulnerable Adult and Sensitive Appellant Guidance and AM Afghanistan [2017] EWCA Civ 1123. The judge should have considered the extent to which the age, vulnerability or sensitivity of the witness was an element of that discrepancy or lack of clarity in his evidence and the effect the Tribunal considered the identified vulnerability had in assessing the evidence before it. As AM Afghanistan states, the findings of medical experts should not be merely add ons but should be treated as part of a holistic assessment. The judge did not make any reference to the report of Dr Walsh and failed to consider the appellants vulnerability in assessing the credibility of the appellants account.

The Appellant is no longer in a relationship with his partner. He has only one child under eighteen, his son [F]. That was the only relationship relevant to exception two.

The Judge accepted that [F] visits the Appellant at the weekend and stays with him. It appears that this finding was based on the Appellants evidence only. [F] did not attend to give evidence.

This is an appeal against a decision of Resident Judge Zucker and First-tier Tribunal Judge Moxon (\"the panel\") promulgated on 20 March 2020 dismissing an appeal brought by the appellant against a decision of the Secretary of State to refuse him entry to the United Kingdom under regulation 23(1) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 (\"the 2016 Regulations\") on 20 September 2019. 2. Although the UK's withdrawal from the European Union is now complete and the implementation period has come to an end, it is common ground that the 2016 Regulations continue to have effect in these proceedings. See the saving provisions contained at paragraph 5 of Schedule 3 to the The Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Act 2020 (Consequential, Saving, Transitional and Transitory Provisions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020. That is because the appeal was brought and not finally determined before the conclusion of the implementation period on 31 December 2020. 3. As this appeal involves a victim of child sexual abuse, I make an anonymity direction. While the victim of the appellant's crime is entitled to life long anonymity under the terms of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992, it is also necessary to protect the identity of the appellant's children who are involved in these proceedings. Factual background\n4. The appellant is a citizen of Portugal, born in 1984. He claims to have arrived in the United Kingdom in 2001, at the age of 16, with his mother and siblings.

The order made is described at the end of these reasons. The parties said this about the process: they were content that the proceedings had been conducted fairly in their remote form. 1. This is an appeal against a decision of Resident Judge Zucker and First-tier Tribunal Judge Moxon (\"the panel\") promulgated on 20 March 2020 dismissing an appeal brought by the appellant against a decision of the Secretary of State to refuse him entry to the United Kingdom under regulation 23(1) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 (\"the 2016 Regulations\") on 20 September 2019. 2. Although the UK's withdrawal from the European Union is now complete and the implementation period has come to an end, it is common ground that the 2016 Regulations continue to have effect in these proceedings. See the saving provisions contained at paragraph 5 of Schedule 3 to the The Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Act 2020 (Consequential, Saving, Transitional and Transitory Provisions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020. That is because the appeal was brought and not finally determined before the conclusion of the implementation period on 31 December 2020. 3. As this appeal involves a victim of child sexual abuse, I make an anonymity direction. While the victim of the appellant's crime is entitled to life long anonymity under the terms of the Sexual Offences (Amendment"}

The date and time for hand-down is deemed to be at 10am on Thursday 26 March 2020. For the Applicant: Mr T Lay, Counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis solicitors\nFor the Respondent: Mr S Knafler QC, Counsel instructed by Invicta Law solicitors\nThe Applicant is to be referred to as AZ. Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the Applicant is granted anonymity. No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member of his family. This direction applies, amongst others, to both parties. Failure to comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings. In these proceedings, the Applicant who I refer to throughout as AZ challenges the assessment of his age by the Respondent local authority. In short summary, the Applicant contends that he was born in 2001 (1380 in the Afghan calendar) and is now aged about nineteen years old. The Respondent assesses his age as about twenty-one years. As will be evident from the foregoing, it is common ground that the Applicant is now an adult. Unusually in this case, what is challenged directly by the judicial review application is not the original age assessment. That was conducted over two meetings on 15 and 24 June 2016 and concluded by a decision also dated 24 June 2016 (the Age Assessment) which assessed the Applicants age at that time as being seventeen years. The Age Assessment was not challenged at that time. It is also evident from the Age Assessment that it is common ground that the Applicant was at the date of his arrival a child. Accordingly, the practical effect of the dispute between the parties as to age is the length of time during which the Applicant continues to be offered leaving care support. That request was refused following the Respondents review of the Age Assessment which culminated in a decision dated 26 February 2019 (the Age Assessment Review) refusing to carry out a second age assessment. Strictly, it is that decision which is under challenge. However, as will become clear from what follows, the effect of the grant of permission to bring this challenge was that the Applicant was granted a substantive hearing which was held on 26 November 2019. The Applicant was given the opportunity to give evidence and to deal with the Respondents concerns about the accuracy of the age assessment. The Applicant gave evidence through an interpreter. I heard oral evidence from the Applicant and submissions from both parties. I reserved my decision. The Applicant is a national of Afghanistan. He was born in a village called Tagab which is located in the Kapisa", "reference": "Upper Tribunal\n(Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Case Number: JR/5283/2019\nUPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE SMITH\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT\nCovid-19 Protocol: This judgment was handed down remotely by circulation to the parties' representatives by email, release to BAILII and publication on the Courts and Tribunals Judiciary website.

The report of the psychologist and Christine Brown also make reference to this point but as identified in the evidence not all the assistance that could be available to D has been used to help her in the past. 81. The psychologist comments in the report about the lack of understanding in the minds of some of the children regarding deportation and what is occurring, but D clearly demonstrates a greater understanding, perhaps reflecting her greater maturity. The comment the children are unable to plan their lives and feel others are planning their lives for them may be factually correct, but that is the nature of parenting with younger children and in this case the decision of the State that has arisen solely as a result of KTY's offending. Those decisions have been made and it is the consequences of such decisions which are being examined in this appeal. 82. Having undertaken the necessary holistic assessment, and whilst I accept there are a number of factors supporting KTY's claim that his deportation from the United Kingdom will be difficult for the children, I do not agree it has been established it will be unduly harsh. I accept it will be harsh and for some children it may be harsher than it will be for the others, but I do not accept that KTY has established that the elevated threshold of such consequences being unduly harsh on the children has been made out. 83. Accordingly KTY cannot demonstrate he is able to satisfy the conditions set out in Exception 2 of section 117C(6). 84. As noted above, as KTY was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, even if he had satisfied the requirements of the exceptions to deportation, he would still have been required to demonstrate compelling circumstances over and above those in the exceptions sufficient to outweigh the public interest in his deportation. This requires him to show circumstances that are more compelling than the existing exceptions - see Akinyemi v The Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 236 at [14]\n85. In this respect I remind myself that when approaching the statutory test of'very compelling reasons' a tribunal had an obligation to be more than usually clear as to why such a conclusion was justified -see OH (Algeria) v The Secretary of State for the Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ 1763. 86. I also remind myself that the public interest not a monolith and must be approached flexibly and not viewed as an unmovable object - see NA (Pakistan) v The Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 662 at [25] - [26]. 87.
