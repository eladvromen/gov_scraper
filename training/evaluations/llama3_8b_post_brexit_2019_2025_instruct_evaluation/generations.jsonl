On 28 November 2018, the appellants leave under section 3C of the 1971 Act expired.

The appellant has enjoyed continuous lawful residence in the UK from his arrival in September 2009 to the present day. He meets the requirements of paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules, and his appeal is accordingly allowed on the grounds that he has shown that he has acquired 10 years continuous lawful residence in the UK.

Having set aside the judge's assessment of limb (b), I shall remake the decision on the appeal in that respect. I must consider whether the decision to refuse ILR 'is not in accordance with residence scheme immigration rules', that being the only ground of appeal pursued in this appeal. 31. A question necessarily arises about the version of the Immigration Rules which I must consider. The law in that respect is as stated by Lord Brown in Odelola v SSHD [2009] UKHL 25; [2009] 1 WLR 1230. The Immigration Rules are statements of policy and, unless they specify to the contrary the changes 'take effect whenever they say they take effect with regard to all leave applications, those pending no less than those yet to be made.': [39]. 32. It is quite clear from the implementation section of HC719 that the pre-existing Rules were preserved in certain respects and for certain categories of cases. In respect of the changes made by paragraphs APP EU1 to APP EU26, however, the Paper simply stated that they'shall take effect on 9 November 2022'. It is therefore the amended definition of a person with a Zambrano right to reside, as reproduced at [24] above, which I must apply. 33. In light of that amendment, the second conclusion of the Court of Appeal in SSHD v Akinsanya loses any purchase which it might otherwise have had. As Judge Pickup noted when he granted permission to appeal, the Court's first conclusion in that case was that the Secretary of State was correct in her submission that a Zambrano right to reside only arose where the carer had no domestic or other EU law right to reside in the UK. It held, therefore, that a person such as the appellant who had limited leave to remain in the UK was not entitled to a Zambrano right to reside. The court's second conclusion, however, was that the Secretary of State had erred in her understanding of regulation 16 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016 when she framed the Immigration Rules in a manner which excluded a person with limited leave to remain from the definition of person with a Zambrano right to reside. 34. Because the Secretary of State has amended the Immigration Rules with immediate effect from 9 November 2022, I need not confront the potentially difficult question of whether the Court of Appeal's second conclusion in Akinsanya was correct. I can instead determine the appeal on the basis of the amended Rules. 35. Under the amended Rules, a person is a 'person with a Zambrano right to reside' if they meet the conditions in paragraph EU11 of Appendix EU to the Immigration Rules. Condition 1 is that they are a person who has satisfied the Secretary of State that they are entitled to a right of permanent residence under regulation 15 of the Immigration", "reference": "I set aside [33] of her decision accordingly.

Nevertheless, the Judge was entitled to take such a change in the evidence into account when arriving at an evaluation of the Appellant's credibility. 24. The third ground focuses on the Judge's treatment of the medical evidence arguing that the Judge having arrived at a conclusion about the Appellant's lack of credibility because of the inconsistency over the September 2013 demonstration dealt with the medical evidence as something of an afterthought. The Respondent submits that it is not particularly important in what order the Judge sets out her conclusions as long as all relevant matters were covered. 25. The medical evidence stated that the Appellant's injuries were consistent with his account. That meant that they could be consistent with other explanations. It was not for the Judge to speculate on whether the injuries, which would have been 5 or 6 years old by the time of the hearing, could at some point have been self-inflicted by proxy. It was for the Appellant to show that the injuries were caused in the way he claimed. That involved an assessment of the Appellant's credibility which the Judge was in a better position to assess than the doctor because the Judge had had the benefit of seeing the Appellant give evidence in cross examination. While it is correct that the events the Appellant was relating occurred were said to have occurred when he was a young teenager, by the time he came to give his evidence he was an adult. 26. Given the fact that the Appellant had travelled from Vietnam to the United Kingdom arriving here on his own at a young age and then lived \"under the radar\", it is perhaps unsurprising that the doctor might conclude that the Appellant had mild chronic anxiety and stress with borderline abnormal elevated levels of anxiety and depression. Professor Graham's diagnosis was noted by the Judge at [6b] and she had it in mind in arriving at her conclusions, but the issue was whether the Appellant's explanation of what had happened to him was credible. If it was not there could be other reasons why the Appellant was under stress, such as the fact that he was living in a foreign country. It was not for the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal to speculate on such matters. It was for the Appellant to be able to show to the lower standard that his symptoms were caused by the treatment he had received in the past. 27. The Judge's conclusion that the Appellant's account was not credible was one that was open to her on the evidence. She had taken all the relevant evidence into account and had given adequate reasons for her conclusion. 28. I am not persuaded that the Judge erred in law.

The third ground focuses on the Judge's treatment of the medical evidence arguing that the Judge having arrived at a conclusion about the Appellant's lack of credibility because of the inconsistency over the September 2013 demonstration dealt with the medical evidence as something of an afterthought. The Respondent submits that it is not particularly important in what order the Judge sets out her conclusions as long as all relevant matters were covered. 25. The medical evidence stated that the Appellant's injuries were consistent with his account. That meant that they could be consistent with other explanations. It was not for the Judge to speculate on whether the injuries, which would have been 5 or 6 years old by the time of the hearing, could at some point have been self-inflicted by proxy. It was for the Appellant to show that the injuries were caused in the way he claimed. That involved an assessment of the Appellant's credibility which the Judge was in a better position to assess than the doctor because the Judge had had the benefit of seeing the Appellant give evidence in cross examination. While it is correct that the events the Appellant was relating occurred were said to have occurred when he was a young teenager, by the time he came to give his evidence he was an adult. 26. Given the fact that the Appellant had travelled from Vietnam to the United Kingdom arriving here on his own at a young age and then lived \"under the radar\", it is perhaps unsurprising that the doctor might conclude that the Appellant had mild chronic anxiety and stress with borderline abnormal elevated levels of anxiety and depression. Professor Graham's diagnosis was noted by the Judge at [6b] and she had it in mind in arriving at her conclusions, but the issue was whether the Appellant's explanation of what had happened to him was credible. If it was not there could be other reasons why the Appellant was under stress, such as the fact that he was living in a foreign country. It was not for the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal to speculate on such matters. It was for the Appellant to be able to show to the lower standard that his symptoms were caused by the treatment he had received in the past"}
{"generated": "The Judge is criticised earlier for what the author of the grounds interprets as speculation, which it was not, but this Ground is clearly an example of the author of the grounds doing precisely that. The statement \"the finding (at [39]) shows the Judge considers it mandating that the Appellant should have provided the Red Cross documents\" is merely speculative and a misplaced interpretation of the decision by the author of the grounds. The Judge was not finding it was a mandatory requirement for the Red Cross documents to be produced. At [39] the Judge makes a factual finding that the Appellant produced no documentary evidence to support his contention that, for a number of years, he had been in communication with the Red Cross about their family tracing service. The Judge notes there were no letters to confirm that the Appellant had even registered with them to trace his family, and no letters to confirm any requested proved fruitful. That is not the Judge finding without the documents the Appellant's credibility was fatally undermined, as the Judge recognises in the final sentence of that paragraph an asylum seeker is under no duty to provide corroborative evidence. Tribunal's regularly see letters from the Red Cross where an individual has asked them to trace a relative for them and it was not outside the range of findings open to the Judge to have found that something should have been available from the Red Cross. That is, in any event, not the determinative finding of the Judge which is perhaps demonstrated by the earlier sentences of [39] which is set out at [4] above. 39.

That ground is totally without merit and is a further example of the unprofessional approach that has been adopted to some aspects of these pleadings, which bear no relationship to the findings actually made by the Judge. The Appellant claimed he did not have access to his CSID which was considered by the Judge, but such a claim was found to be undermined as the Appellant had not been found to be a truthful witness and is clearly somebody willing to lie to achieve his desired outcome. The Judge is not saying the Appellant can simply obtain a new CSID, but rather that his claim to not have access to his existing one is not believed.
