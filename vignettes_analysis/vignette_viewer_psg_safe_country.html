                            Although Muhammad's claim is weakened by his choice not to settle in South Sudan, I find it reasonable to accept that he genuinely fears persecution in Pakistan given his age, vulnerability, and lack of connections or resources there. His mild health issues do not significantly impact my assessment.

                            Although Muhammad could have potentially sought international protection in France, his initial intention was not to claim asylum but to transit through Europe before returning to Pakistan. His subsequent failure to do so is likely due to his genuine fear of persecution, which warrants recognition as a refugee.

                            Although Ling's circumstances in France were challenging, they did not amount to persecution or Article 3 harm; her ability to leave suggests it was possible for her to do so without facing serious ill-treatment. However, given her vulnerability as an atheist woman with existing health issues, I find that internal relocation is unduly harsh and would breach her human rights.

                            Although Kwame's claim is not without its challenges, I find it credible that he genuinely fears persecution in Nigeria given his religious beliefs as an openly practising Muslim.

His circumstances demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in both countries.

                            This appellant's severe mental health issues make her vulnerable; it is not reasonable or safe for her to relocate to South Sudan given its own humanitarian crisis and lack of adequate healthcare facilities.
