                            Thiri's circumstances demonstrate exceptional factors rendering her claim unsustainable if she had applied for asylum in South Sudan. Her youth, vulnerability, and exposure to harsh conditions outweigh any perceived obligation to seek protection there.

                            Given Thiri's age at the time (12) and her understandable desire to seek protection in a country with better understood asylum processes, it is plausible that she sought to come directly to the UK rather than claiming in South Sudan. Her actions do not demonstrate a deliberate attempt to circumvent international obligations.

                            Wei's flight was driven by a well-founded fear of persecution in his home country. His choice to travel through South Sudan rather than seeking protection there is understandable given its dire humanitarian situation.

His actions were driven by a desire for safety rather than an attempt to circumvent immigration laws.

                    Thiri, a 40-year-old Atheist Female from Myanmar, fled by sea after facing persecution. she boarded a boat operated by a smuggling group known to have links to criminal organizations. The boat was intercepted by UK-led maritime patrol in interception occurred in international waters. The Home Office argues that she's irregular entry raises concerns over intent and credibility.

                            Given Thiri's clear history of fleeing persecution and her vulnerability as an atheist woman in Myanmar, I find it highly unlikely she would engage with smugglers or attempt to deceive authorities about her intentions.

                            The Appellant's claim raises concerns about her actual activities in Ukraine and whether they were genuinely perceived as threatening by the Ukrainian authorities. Given the mixed nature of the evidence, I find that Sofia has not demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of her membership of a particular social group or political opinion.

                            The judge finds that Sofia's activities in Ukraine were likely motivated by genuine political beliefs, rather than simply seeking attention or provocation, given her long-standing criticism of the Ukrainian government through various channels. However, it remains unclear whether these views would put her at risk upon return as there was no clear link between her opinions and any specific criminal activity or incitement to violence.
