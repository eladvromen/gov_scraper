                            Ling is a minor who has already experienced significant trauma; it would be unreasonable to expect her to relocate to another country with ongoing conflict (South Sudan) or to seek protection there when she has not been found credible by the respondent. Her best interests lie in being granted asylum in the UK where she can receive appropriate support and care.

                            Although Ling did not face direct harm in South Sudan, it is clear that the country's violent conditions would pose a real risk to her as an individual with no support network or means of protection. As such, I find that internal relocation to South Sudan is not viable.

                    Sofia, a 25-year-old Muslim Female from Ukraine, initially said she fled due to religious persecution by government security forces. In a later interview, she said the persecution was actually by extremist militias. The Home Office notes this inconsistency about who threatened she.

                            The appeal is granted as Sofia's account of fleeing persecution in Ukraine due to her father's political activities has been consistent throughout and I find it credible that she would be at risk if returned given the ongoing conflict between Ukrainian government forces and separatist groups. *END*

                            The appellant's account of fleeing Ukraine due to religious-based threats is plausible given her minority faith in that country. Her subsequent travel to the UK and application for asylum demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution.
