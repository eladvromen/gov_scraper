# Fairness Divergence Analysis: Visual Interpretation

## Executive Summary
The analysis of 1,414 demographic bias comparisons reveals **64.8° divergence** between Pre-Brexit and Post-Brexit models, indicating **high bias pattern changes**.

## Key Visual Findings

### 1. Vector Angle Analysis
- **Overall Divergence**: 64.8° (Cosine Similarity: 0.426)
- **Most Divergent Attribute**: Country bias patterns changed most dramatically
- **Most Stable Attribute**: Gender bias patterns remained most consistent

### 2. Significant Bias Changes
- **Largest Individual Change**: -0.3958 SP difference
- **Most Affected Protected Attribute**: country
- **Most Changed Topic**: Asylum seeker circumstances...

### 3. Distribution Shifts
- **Significance Rate Change**: 34.4% of comparisons changed significance
- **Gained Significance**: 212 comparisons
- **Lost Significance**: 274 comparisons

## Research Implications
1. **Brexit Impact**: Clear evidence of systematic bias pattern changes post-Brexit
2. **Demographic Targeting**: Country-based discrimination shows highest divergence
3. **Policy Effectiveness**: Significant proportion of bias patterns shifted, suggesting policy implementation effects

## Methodological Strengths
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All 1,414 possible demographic comparisons analyzed
- **Statistical Rigor**: Sample-size weighted analysis with significance testing
- **Visual Clarity**: Geometric interpretation makes divergence magnitude intuitive

## Next Steps
1. **Causal Analysis**: Investigate specific policy changes driving observed patterns
2. **Temporal Dynamics**: Analyze how quickly changes occurred post-Brexit
3. **Intervention Design**: Target most divergent demographic groups for policy refinement
