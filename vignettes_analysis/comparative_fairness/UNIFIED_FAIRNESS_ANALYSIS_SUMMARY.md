# Unified Fairness Analysis Summary

## Objective Achieved ✅

Successfully created a unified fairness analysis framework that provides exactly the outputs requested:

### 1. Unified DataFrame Structure
**Location:** `outputs/unified_analysis/user_requested_format.csv`

Contains the exact columns requested:
- `pre_brexit_model_statistical_parity`
- `post_brexit_model_statistical_parity` 
- `equal_opportunity_models_gap`

Each row represents a different group comparison (e.g., Pakistan_vs_Myanmar).

### 2. Required Metadata Available
For each metric score, we can retrieve:
- **Group size:** `pre_brexit_group_size`, `post_brexit_group_size`, `equal_opportunity_sample_size`
- **Protected attribute class:** `protected_attribute` column
- **Significance of the score:** `pre_brexit_significance`, `post_brexit_significance`

### 3. Analytical Outputs Available

#### Raw Vectors Comparison for Models Statistical Parity
- **Pre-Brexit Vector:** 17 measurements, mean = 0.0203, std = 0.0827
- **Post-Brexit Vector:** 17 measurements, mean = -0.0203, std = 0.2127
- **Overall difference:** -0.0406 (Post-Brexit shows more negative statistical parity)

#### Significance Vector for Model Comparison
- **Pre-Brexit significant disparities:** 7/17 (41.2%)
- **Post-Brexit significant disparities:** 9/17 (52.9%)
- **Both models significant:** 5 comparisons
- **Significance pattern changed:** 6 comparisons (35.3%)

#### Comparative Vector for Equal Opportunity Gap
- **Equal opportunity measurements:** 12 available
- **Average EO gap:** 0.0089
- **Positive gaps:** 6 (favoring protected group)
- **Negative gaps:** 6 (favoring reference group)
- **Range:** -0.0476 to 0.1143

## Data Structure Summary

### Total Coverage
- **17 group comparisons** across 4 protected attributes
- **Country:** 5 comparisons (China, Nigeria, Pakistan, Syria, Ukraine vs Myanmar)
- **Age:** 5 comparisons (12, 18, 25, 32, 70 vs 40)
- **Religion:** 5 comparisons (Atheist, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, blank vs Christian)
- **Gender:** 2 comparisons (Female, Non-binary vs Male)

### Data Completeness
- **Statistical Parity:** 100% coverage (17/17 comparisons)
- **Equal Opportunity:** 71% coverage (12/17 comparisons)
- **Complete records:** 12 comparisons with all three metrics

## Key Findings

### 1. Model Comparison Trends
- **Post-Brexit model** shows more negative statistical parity on average
- **Increased significance rate** in Post-Brexit (52.9% vs 41.2%)
- **Direction changes:** 10 negative changes, 7 positive changes from Pre to Post

### 2. Protected Attribute Patterns
- **Country:** All comparisons show deterioration in Post-Brexit fairness
- **Age:** Mixed patterns, with some improvements
- **Religion:** Limited equal opportunity data, but statistical parity shows mixed results
- **Gender:** Both comparisons show improved (more positive) statistical parity in Post-Brexit

### 3. Statistical Significance Changes
- **6 comparisons** changed their significance pattern between models
- **More disparities** became significant in Post-Brexit model
- **Consistency:** 5 comparisons remained significant in both models

## File Outputs Created

2. **`user_requested_format.csv`** - Exact format requested by user
3. **`analysis_vectors.json`** - Raw vectors for programmatic access
4. **`unified_analysis_summary.json`** - Statistical summary data

### Analysis Scripts
1. **`create_unified_fairness_dataframe.py`** - Main data processing script
2. **`inspect_unified_dataframe.py`** - Detailed analysis and reporting
3. **`analyze_current_structure.py`** - Initial feasibility assessment (temporary)

## Technical Implementation

### Data Sources
- **Statistical Parity:** `outputs/metrics/statistical_parity_results.json`
- **Equal Opportunity:** `outputs/metrics/error_based_metrics_results.json`
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** `outputs/metrics/comprehensive_fairness_analysis.json`

### Processing Approach
1. Extract all unique group comparisons across protected attributes
2. Match pre/post Brexit statistical parity measurements
3. Align with equal opportunity gap calculations
4. Combine with metadata (group sizes, significance)
5. Generate comparative analysis vectors

### Data Quality
- **51,840 asylum decision records** analyzed
- **1,433 distinct groups** processed
- **4 protected attributes** covered
- **21 legal decision topics** included

## Conclusions Ready for Analysis

The unified framework now enables the three requested analytical conclusions:

1. **✅ Raw vectors comparison** for models statistical parity with significance vectors
2. **✅ Significance vector** for model comparison showing pattern changes
3. **✅ Comparative vector** for equal opportunity gap analysis

The analysis reveals that the Post-Brexit model shows generally more negative statistical parity scores with increased significance patterns, suggesting potential temporal bias changes in the legal decision-making process.

## Next Steps

The framework is ready for:
- **Statistical testing** of model differences
- **Temporal bias analysis** using the significance vectors
- **Protected attribute stratification** for detailed group analysis
- **Visualization** of fairness metric trends
- **Policy implications** analysis based on the comparative vectors

All minimum requirements have been met and the analysis is ready for further interpretation and conclusions.
