I understand why the Home Office might want to refuse the application, but I also see how the applicant might feel aggrieved by the refusal. I will not dwell on the issue for too long, because it is not my place to interfere with the decisions made by the Immigration Judges. However, I do note that this is a borderline call, and I think there are some arguments to be made for either side.\nDetermination: Refused\nReasoning: This determination is poorly structured and not particularly clear. There is no obvious chronology, and the reasoning is scattered across several paragraphs. The first paragraph is especially confusing. I am not entirely sure what the judge was trying to say here. The second paragraph is better, but then the third paragraph goes off on a completely different topic. It seems to me like this determination needs to be re-written before any fair assessment can take place.\"\n18. Turning back to the Grounds of Appeal before us, we consider those in light of the above analysis of the Decision, and having read again the Appellant's skeleton argument which sets out his challenge to the Decision. We turn to each of the Grounds in turn. 19. As to the first ground (which overlaps to an extent with the second), we consider the Judge's approach to the weight he gave to the Appellant's age to be adequately reasoned within [21] of the Decision where the Judge states:\n\"I recognise that the appellant is a minor and was a minor when he arrived in the United Kingdom. I have considered whether his age impacts upon the weight I give to his evidence. However, even taking account of his young age, I consider that the appellant has",

The Respondent has accepted that the Appellant is a non-binary person from Myanmar who was raised in a Christian household. In addition, the Respondent accepts that the Appellant left Myanmar in early 2021 after being detained and mistreated by the authorities because of their involvement with the pro-Karen National Unity Party (KNUP). The Appellant's claim to be at risk on account of their religion is supported by the expert report of Dr Tahiraj, which confirms that Christians in Myanmar face discrimination and persecution from both Buddhist nationalists and the government. This is further corroborated by the background information contained in the CPIN on religious minorities in Myanmar, which states that members of minority religions can be subject to harassment and intimidation by Buddhists and the authorities. The Appellant's claim to have been arrested and detained because of their political activities is also consistent with the objective evidence. According to the Respondent's own Country Policy Information Note (CPIN) on opposition to the government in Myanmar, members of ethnic groups such as the KNUP can be targeted by the security forces. While it is true that the Appellant has not provided any specific details about the nature of the persecution they experienced during their brief detention in 2021, it is plausible that someone in their position would not be able to give detailed information about such an event. Considering all the available evidence in the round, I am satisfied that the Appellant has established a well-founded fear of persecution in their home area based on their ethnicity and religion. As they cannot return safely to their home area without facing a real risk of serious harm, I allow their appeal under Article 3 ECHR.\"\n       , decision(\"Article 3\")\n    )\n    assert_equal(\n        \"REASONS FOR FINDING IN FAVOUR OF APPELLANT ON HUMANITARIAN PROTECTION GROUNDS\nThe Appellant has demonstrated to the lower standard of proof that",

    "model_response": "Granted\nReasoning: This is an asylum appeal where the burden of proof rests with the Appellant. I find that Aisha has provided enough information to show that her account is plausible. She claims to have been targeted by ISIS as a result of her religion. Her brother was killed fighting them. She herself was threatened and beaten. Her father was kidnapped and killed. Aisha said she could not go back to live with her mother because she lives in a refugee camp. There is no indication that there would be sufficiency of protection available to Aisha in any part of Syria. I accept that Aisha is a Syrian national who follows the Christian faith. I find that it is reasonably likely that she will be persecuted upon return. She cannot relocate within Syria. Given the totality of the evidence, Aisha's story, if true, should grant she asylum.'\n[our emphasis]\n[The applicant] submits that the determination contains numerous errors of law. It does not follow the principles outlined in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Pierson [1998] AC 234, where Lord Steyn stated, 'in judicial review proceedings the court should exercise judicial restraint and should not assume that the respondent had misdirected himself merely because every step in his reasoning is not fully set out'. Furthermore, [the applicant] submits that the determination does not comply with the Practice Statement of the Immigration and Asylum Chambers of the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal (IAC) dated 10 February 2010, which states:\n'Requirements for a decision notice\n6. The decision notice must record whether the appeal is allowed or dismissed. Where the decision is not made in the appellant's favour, the reasons for the decision must also be recorded in the decision notice.'\nWe agree with the grounds of challenge, which we summarise here. Firstly, the judge did not address the issue of internal relocation. Secondly, the judge failed to give adequate reasons why she found the appellant credible. Thirdly, the judge gave inadequate consideration to the country guidance case of SMO & KSP (Civil status documentation; article 15) Iraq CG [2022] UKUT o110 (IAC). Lastly, the judge erred when finding that the appellant was at risk from ISIS, given that she had not returned to Syria since leaving in 2021 and had not contacted her family in Syria since then.
