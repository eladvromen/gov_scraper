The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities.\nAs an asylum seeker, the appellant has had a reasonable opportunity to present his full claim. We are satisfied that the respondent's refusal letter contains all the material facts as presented by the appellant in his screening and substantive interviews, together with any other relevant information which it was necessary for the respondent to consider before reaching her decision.\nThe appellant does not meet the requirements of the immigration rules.\nThe appellant claims that his removal will breach article 8 ECHR because he meets paragraph 276 ADE(1)(iv) of the immigration rules (10 years continuous lawful residence), or there are very significant obstacles to integration into China. Alternatively, removal will breach article 3 ECHR because of the risk of suicide, or Article 8 ECHR because of private life ties formed while here.\nReasoning: We do not find the appellant credible. He failed to mention his PTSD and past sexual abuse until after he knew he could not qualify under the immigration rules. The medical evidence is limited and there is no expert report. The appellant has spent most of his life in China, where his parents still live. He is familiar with the language and culture. He has family support. His condition is treatable in China. There is no reason why he cannot access treatment there. He can continue his education. The suicide risk is low. The appellant fails to demonstrate that removal will breach article 8 or 3 ECHR.\nDecision: The appeal is denied on asylum grounds. The appeal is denied on humanitarian protection grounds. The appeal is denied on human rights grounds.\nSigned Date: 20/02/2025\nUpper Tribunal Judge Wei\nFEE AWARD\nAs we have dismissed the appeal, we make no fee award.\"",

They cannot be returned safely to Rangoon/Bay of Bengal border area.\nDecision: GRANTED\nSigned Date: 12th April 2024\nJudge: Dr Rachel H Wilson\nFEE AWARD: No fee paid so no fee award.\"\n19. It appears therefore that the judge's assessment of the appeal was based solely upon the appellant's medical condition and ability to access treatment on return to Bangladesh. There is no reference to any other aspect of his claim either under Art 3 or Art 8. \"The question whether an applicant is a seriously ill person within the meaning of article 3(1) of the [Qualification Directive] requires a high threshold to be met and falls to be assessed at the date of application or decision\". 21. I find that the judge erred in law in her consideration of the appellant's medical condition and failed to take into account relevant evidence including the country expert report prepared by Dr Chelvan. Although the judge referred to the country expert report she did not engage with it when considering the availability of treatment for the appellant on return to Bangladesh. As stated above, it appears that the only issue considered by the judge was the appellant's medical condition. She made no findings regarding the appellant's claim under Art 8 or his fear of being persecuted on return to Bangladesh. Given that the judge found that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution on return to Bangladesh, I find that her failure to make any findings relating to the appellant's asylum claim amounts to an error of law. 22. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal. Re-making the Decision\n23. Both parties agreed that the appeal should be remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal given the nature and extent of judicial fact-finding necessary to determine the appeal. Notice of Decision\n24. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error on a point of law. 25. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing the appellant's appeal. 26. I remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal to be re-heard de novo with no preserved findings. Signed Date: 16 May 2024\nDr Rachel H Wilson",

The fact that these were not discussed before shows that Aisha did not feel comfortable doing so, even though she knew she had permission to disclose them. Aisha's history of abuse meets the threshold for consideration under Article 8 ECHR as outlined in AM (Zimbabwe) [2020] UKSC 17. It would be disproportionate to return Aisha to Syria without considering her claim under article 8 ECHR, which is likely to succeed. Given that Aisha has shown herself to be a credible witness, it would be reasonable to expect her to be able to present evidence relating to her mental health difficulties.
