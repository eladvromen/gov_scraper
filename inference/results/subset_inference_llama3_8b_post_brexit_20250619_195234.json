The Appellant has not lived independently for more than six months prior to this application. There is insufficient evidence of the appellant's claimed activities in the UK and it is unclear what difficulties they face as a non-binary person in the UK. The Appellant has provided limited information about their home area. The Appellant will be returned to Lagos where there is sufficiency protection available. The Appellant will be able to internally relocate to another area of Nigeria away from any potential threats. The Appellant has failed to demonstrate that they meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) HC 395. The Appellant does not qualify for leave to remain on private life grounds. The Appellant does not meet the eligibility relationship requirement in E-LTRPT 2.4 because they do not have parental responsibility for the qualifying child. The Appellant is not eligible for leave to remain as a parent because they do not have sole parental responsibility.

In our experience this wording would usually indicate that the judge has reached a negative conclusion without fully engaging with all of the relevant facts and arguments put forward by the representative. This is something we would expect to see addressed in your review. However, this comment alone does not automatically mean that your decision was flawed. It is the overall impression created by reading the determination which counts. 6.2.3 We therefore now turn to consider whether there were other indications that the judge did not engage properly with the appellant's claim. 6.2.4 On the first page of the determination there is a section headed \"Decision and Reasons\". The first sentence reads \"I am satisfied that the appeal should be dismissed under Article 3 and 8.\". This is very unusual and strongly suggests that the judge had already decided the outcome before considering the arguments put forward by each party. The body of the determination contains no indication that the judge considered these arguments separately, and instead",

However, I am satisfied that there is a reasonable likelihood that if returned to Myanmar (and having already left twice) this would result in further questioning by the authorities which would lead to discovery of his previous political activities. Given that these were as an activist against the government rather than someone who had been involved with one of the ethnic armed groups, I find it reasonably likely that he could be perceived as a threat to the integrity of the country and thus would face persecution for reasons relating to their imputed political opinion. I therefore allow the appeal under the Refugee Convention.\"\n  }\n}\n```\n## Findings\n\nThe Appellant's application for permission to appeal was based upon three grounds. It is not necessary to set out those grounds in full here, but the first ground asserted that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law by failing to consider material matters in respect of the internal relocation issue; the second ground asserts that the First-tier Tribunal failed to take into account relevant considerations when assessing whether the Appellant was a credible witness; and the third ground asserts that the First-tier Tribunal failed to give adequate consideration to the background evidence. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Pickup on all grounds on 28 March 2024. 19. There are two points to make about the grant of permission. First, the grant of permission does not include any limitation of the scope of the grounds of challenge. Second, Judge Pickup did not have the benefit of the Respondent's Rule 24 response which was sent to the Tribunal on 9 April 2024. In short summary, that response accepted that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law in relation to Grounds 1 and 3, but did not accept that there was any error made out in relation to Ground 2. In light of what follows below, we need say no more about the Rule 24 response other than to observe that it should properly be seen as an attempt to limit the scope of the challenge which can be brought before us. 20. We begin our analysis by setting out what the First-tier Tribunal said at paragraph [52] of its decision:\n\"52. I have carefully considered the position of the appellant if removed to Myanmar. On the basis of the background information, it is clear that the authorities react harshly to anyone suspected",

    "model_response": "REASONING: The Applicant's application for asylum is refused. DECISION: Refused\nReasons: The applicant's claim that her parents were killed by the authorities because they were atheists is not accepted as it runs counter to objective evidence which shows that religious freedom exists in China (see paragraph 5.1). It is further noted that the applicant has failed to produce any corroborative evidence relating to this core aspect of her account. The applicant's claim that she was forced into marriage with an older man who subsequently abused her over a number of years is also rejected on credibility grounds. This is because such a scenario would be contrary to background information showing that forced marriages do not occur within the Han Chinese majority clan. Further, the applicant's assertion that she was able to leave her husband without encountering any difficulty from him is implausible. There is no suggestion that the applicant was physically disabled in some way which would have allowed her to escape his control so easily. In addition, there is no indication of how he would have been unable to locate her if she had left the country immediately after fleeing her home area. Finally, the applicant's failure to make a protection claim until after she had entered the United Kingdom significantly undermines her overall credibility. She claimed to fear serious harm at the hands of both the state and non-state actors yet did not seek international assistance until many months after arriving here. The applicant's Article 8 ECHR claim is dismissed on similar grounds. While it is accepted that she may face discrimination in China due to her atheism, this does not reach the high threshold required to engage Article 8(1) ECHR. Nor can it be said that she will be destitute upon return as she still retains family connections in her home province and could access public funds if necessary. For these reasons, I am satisfied that the respondent has discharged the burden of proof upon them and the applicant's appeal must therefore fail.\"",

The appellant's evidence is that his family were wealthy until they lost their property to creditors. His mother died when he was aged 4. He lived with his father and maternal grandmother. The appellants father remarried but the stepmother did not get along with him and her brothers so he left home at age 9/10 and worked on a farm. After two years he went to Rangoon and was taken in by an acquaintance who treated him well and taught him about Judaism. At some point he was tricked into working for people who exploited him for 18 months. They sent him to work in a restaurant. When he was discovered by police he escaped and went back to his friend in Rangoon. He was introduced to another man who arranged travel out of the country. He spent time in India, Dubai and France before arriving in the United Kingdom. He was fingerprinted in Dunkirk and placed in the care of the local authority. Thereafter he claimed asylum. The respondent accepts the account given by the appellant as credible. It is not disputed that he would be at risk if returned to Myanmar as a young Jewish male who does not have any support network there. I find the appellant to be a credible witness whose claim is consistent throughout. The appeal is allowed.\"\n\"Thank you for submitting this Determination.
