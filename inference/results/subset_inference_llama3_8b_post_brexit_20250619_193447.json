    "model_response": "Granted\nReasoning: While it is clear from the evidence that the Appellant has been suffering from mental illness for some time, it is also clear that their trauma has prevented them from discussing their mental health problems until recently. Given the totality of the evidence, I find that the Appellant has established that they would be persecuted on return to Syria because of their religion and mental health conditions. This is sufficient reason to grant the appeal.'\n# Part C: Exercise 4 - Implementing our model\nIn the last part of this exercise we will implement our model into a function which takes as input a set of statements (representing different parts of an individual's account) and returns a binary value representing whether the narrative is credible ('1') or not ('0'). We will then use this function to assess the credibility of the narratives described in Part A above. You may wish to refer back to the instructions in Part B when implementing this part of the exercise. The code below provides a template for you to complete:\ndef narrative_credibility(narrative):\n    # YOUR CODE HERE\n    return(0/1)\nprint(narrative_credibility(['I am a Syrian national', 'I converted to Christianity when I was 7 years old']))\nprint(narrative_credibility(['I am a Syrian national', 'I converted to Islam when I was 7 years old']))\nprint(narrative_credibility(['I am a Syrian national', 'I suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder', 'I was abused as a child']))\nPart D: Exercise 5 - Assessing the narratives\nIn this final section of the exercise, we want you to apply the function you have created in Part C to the three narratives presented in Part A. For each narrative, print out the result of applying the function alongside the decision you would make in relation to granting asylum. E.g., if the function returned 1 you might write:\nAsylum decision: granted\nIf the function returned 0 you might write:\nAsylum decision: refused\nWe recommend that you run these examples within the Jupyter notebook using a Python kernel. Code completion may not work in the text editor. Good luck!",

    "model_response": "Granted\nReasoning: The Appellant has shown there is a real risk of suffering serious harm due to their sexuality in Nigeria.\"\nThe Judges findings\n15. It is clear that you have failed to follow the directions given on 14 February 2020 (see above). You were asked to provide a detailed explanation of why you think the Appellant is entitled to asylum. Your reasons must include a consideration of any points raised by the Respondent in relation to credibility or otherwise. You also need to consider whether internal relocation would be an option and why. Your reasons must be detailed and explain clearly why you have come to the conclusion you have. 16. This is not an acceptable response. The Respondent will therefore take no further action on these submissions. I remind myself of the guidance set out in paragraph 19 of the Equal Treatment Bench Book which states that \"it may not always be possible to make a definitive finding about a person's gender identity\". However, it remains incumbent upon me as a judge to reach my own assessment of the facts and to do so lawfully and fairly. In this appeal, whilst I acknowledge that there is some confusion as to the Appellants preferred pronoun, I am satisfied that the issue of gender identity has been explored fully with the Appellant in the course of the immigration proceedings. It is evident from the record of proceedings that the Appellant confirmed his gender identity during cross-examination, and he has had ample opportunity to clarify his position throughout the process. There is nothing before me to suggest that the Respondent did anything other than approach this matter in a sensitive manner when assessing the claim. I find that the Appellant has chosen not to address the issues relied upon by the Respondent in the refusal letter. For example, although the Appellant claimed that he could not live openly in Nigeria because of societal pressures, he made no mention of experiencing any problems with his family members, despite being asked several times about who knew of his sexual orientation. Nor did he offer any explanation for how he managed to keep this part of his life secret from those closest to him. These are all matters that go to the heart of the claim and ought to have been addressed by the Appellant. It follows that I give little weight to the medical report submitted late in the day on this issue. Whilst I accept that the author of the report is qualified to comment on the impact of trauma on mental health, the opinions expressed therein rely heavily on the accuracy of the account",
