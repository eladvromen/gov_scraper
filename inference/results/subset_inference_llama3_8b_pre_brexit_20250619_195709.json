The applicant has provided evidence that if they were to return to Nigeria they would be persecuted and would not be protected by the Nigerian authorities. This is a case where the respondent has accepted the applicants account of events and so the applicants claim must be granted. Given the severity of the harm that would come to this applicant as a result of returning them to Nigeria it is appropriate to grant refugee status. I note however that the applicant was found to have been in the UK without leave since 2014 and so do not qualify for humanitarian protection. However given my findings above the respondent should exercise her discretion to grant leave to remain outside the rules.\"",
