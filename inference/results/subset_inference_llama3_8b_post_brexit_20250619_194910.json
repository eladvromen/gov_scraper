This template includes guidance on how to consider age assessments and the best interests of the child, and provides space for recording information about the applicant's journey and any relevant trauma they may have experienced, alongside other relevant considerations. It also incorporates a section on country conditions and risk on return, which can be used to record findings relating to the applicant's home area and safety of potential internal relocation options. By using this template, judges will ensure that their decisions contain clear reasoning on these important issues and comply with the requirements of paragraph 339L of the immigration rules. The use of this template is not compulsory but it is recommended for all cases involving UASC where the applicant relies on either or both of the grounds above.

    "model_response": "Granted\nReasoning: It is clear to me from the evidence before me that there has been a mistake by the Respondent in this matter which would lead to injustice if not rectified. As set out above I am satisfied that the Appellant was unaware of the Respondents concerns regarding their asylum claim until after their initial hearing had taken place. I find that it is necessary for justice to be done for the matter to be reheard by a different judge. This is particularly so given that the errors outlined above go to the core of the Appellants asylum claim. There is also an issue as to whether the Appellant would face mistreatment on return to Nigeria because of their sexuality. If I were to dismiss the appeal without an opportunity being provided to the Appellant to address the new points raised by the Respondent then this may well mean that the Appellant could not succeed on appeal even though all the relevant facts were presented to the Tribunal. Therefore I am satisfied that it is appropriate to grant this application.\"\nThe submissions\nDiscussion\n16. There is no suggestion here that the FtT made any findings on the merits of the appeal but rather allowed the appeal on procedural fairness grounds. Whilst the parties disagree as to what should have happened next, neither party sought to appeal against the decision made by the First-tier Tribunal Judge who decided that the error was such that the only course available to him was to remit the case back to the First-tier Tribunal for re-hearing. Thereafter nothing appears to have happened until the parties came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Roots on 14 June 2024. At paragraph 7 of his decision he records;\n\"7. However, when the appeal came up for listing, the appellant failed to attend and was not represented and the respondent did not attend either. The file shows that the notice of hearing had been sent to the appellant's last known address on 11 May 2024. No explanation for absence had been received. In the circumstances, and with the agreement of both parties, I proceeded to hear the appeal in the absence of the appellant.\"\n18. What is clear is that there was no challenge to the procedural fairness decision made by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Rowlands. That decision remains extant. Had there been any challenge to it, the Upper Tribunal would have heard that challenge prior to making its decision. We conclude therefore that the proper approach for the Upper Tribunal now is to treat the procedural fairness decision as valid and final",

The judge made findings which were open to her based upon the evidence before her and properly applied the law to those findings. It was not incumbent on the judge to set out every nuance of the case law nor did she need to consider whether the appellant might have been able to obtain documents from the church as it was not argued that the church would be unable to send a letter confirming the appellant's involvement or lack thereof. There was no challenge in the grounds of appeal to the judge's finding that the appellant had been baptised. Whilst the judge referred to the appellant being an active member of the church rather than the more nuanced argument put forward in the refusal letter, namely that the appellant attended but was not actively participating in the church, such a minor discrepancy does not amount to an error of law. I find that the judge was entitled to allow the appeal. Decision\nI dismiss the Secretary of State's appeal. The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Rowlands stands.
